            "Detailed PESTLE analysis of Reliance Industries  examiningpolitical, economic, social, technological, legal & environmental factors.",
            "Reliance Industries Limited is the biggest Indian conglomerate. Its business is varied in multiple sectors including telecom, power, retail, cash and carry, petroleum, fashion, mobile etc. Political stability is essential for flow of raw materials and to maintain best in class supply chain efficiency. With political instability the laws change more frequently. It becomes difficult for Reliance Industries to adjust to such frequent law changes considering the massive size of business. Also, the countries in which Reliance Industries has setup its product base in the form of supermarket, product development etc. should not be prone to military invasion. The government laws related to contract, taxation, intellectual property protection is necessary to be in place. Some of the laws that are launched to promote the telecom sector like the unified access services scheme and 100% foreign direct investment in some of the business fragments that Reliance Industries operates in helps to scale the business profitably. Level of government intervention in free market and capital goods is also a decisive political factor.",

            "This concludes the political factors in the Reliance Industries PESTLE Analysis.",
            "Below are the economic factors in the PESTLE Analysis of Reliance Industries:",
            "There are multiple economic factors that impact business of Reliance Industries Limited. Inflation rate in the country decides as to buying capacity of the public in the market.",
            "Too high inflation rate is not preferred for business to be profitable because then the raw material procurement becomes costly resulting in rise in the final product. High interest rates are bad for both business and the customer. Business like Reliance Industries take up loan from various banks to support their financials over the year and the customer to buy high end quality products takes up loans. But when the interest rates shoot up both the level of production and buying strength hampers. The stability in the economic market and exchange rates is important factor to grow the business at desired pace. GDP of the country reflects how the business is going to grow in future.",

            "This 21st century has seen tremendous increase in the spending power of consumer. That has led to business like Reliance Industries to give a large variety of product base with both extreme end of pricing. People these days are society conscious and thus they are inclined towards fashionable brands in apparel, technology fields. Internet these days has become a necessity. Providing the most accessible, reliable and affordable internet was the opportunity that Reliance Industries fetched via Jio product launch. The economic class distribution in that respective area needs to be taken care of. There is no point in promoting premium product to the public who do not have the capability to pay for it. The public these days is more aware of the hazardous effects of consumables on their health as well as on environment.",
            "The technological factors in the PESTLE Analysis of Reliance Industries are mentioned below:",
            "Technology is ever changing. The involvement of technology is effective in every business of Reliance Industries limited. Be it retail and the improved ERP functioning, advance social media marketing or be it advancements in telecom sector like 5G network and fibrenet broadband. The operations and supply chain are getting disrupted with advanced technology.",
            "The huge cash and carry stores of Reliance Industries have robots and machine in place to move huge and heavy chunk of material.",
            "Following are the legal factors in the Reliance Industries PESTLE Analysis:",
            "There are strict laws that govern Reliance Industries’ business in every field. Labor laws which protect basic rights of every labor including minimum wages are to be aligned with the company’s legal framework. Environment protection laws for the manufacturing units and their industrial waste disposal standards govern their overall activity. Contract laws, corporate laws and their adherence with company’s rules is mandatory. There is separate legal team which looks after all kinds of laws which are to be aligned and incorporated in their business. Health and safety laws are strict these days since along with the government the public is also becoming conscious about consumables content and quality.",
            "In the Reliance Industries PESTLE Analysis, the environmental elements affecting its business are as below:",
            "Reliance Industries Limited has diverse business. But each of those businesses, be it petroleum, fashion retail outlet, agricultural products, foot ware have to be monitored in terms of its environmental factors. The emissions that are given out into the air has to be regulated under the norms prescribed by the government. Excess of carbon emissions add to the ozone layer depletion and resulting in global warming in the world. The plastic waste generated cannot be dumped in the water bodies.",
            "All of India is running ‘Swatch Bharat Abhyan’ where in the cleanliness of India is restored back to its original state. The carbon footprints generated by the company are to be minimized as much as possible. There are laws which protect animal life from being killed for business purpose.",

            "By S.K. Singh, Chairperson - All the 3 petitions have been heard at length\n\ntogether because the outcome is dependent upon the answer to a common legal\n\nissue - whether the amendment Regulations of 2018 dated 28.11.2018 framed by\n\nthe   Telecom      Regulatory    Authority     of   India    (TRAI)     will    have\n\nretrospective/retroactive operation so as to bind the parties to the rates redone and\n\nre-enacted through the new schedules in the amendment Regulations of 2018, with\n\neffect from 01.01.2013? While petitioners plead in favour of declaring the new\n\nschedules of 2018 to be retrospective and binding from January 2013, the\n\nrespondent owners / operators of Cable Landing Stations contend otherwise. This\n\njudgment is common and shall govern all the petitions.",
            "2.    It may be useful to note that the facts relevant for the main issue of law\n\nindicated above are not in dispute and hence do not require detailed narration. For\n\nthe sake of convenience, facts will be referred to from the records of T.P.\n\nNo.77/2019 which has been heard as the lead matter, unless indicated otherwise.",
            "3|Page",
            "3.    The two respondents, Tata Communications Ltd. and Bharti Airtel Ltd. are\n\nowners / operators of certain facilities which have been described as Cable\n\nLanding Operations. For these facilities they are entitled to levy three distinct\n\ncharges i.e. (i) Access Facilitation Charges (AFC), (ii) Co-Location Charges(CLC)\n\nand (iii) Operation and Maintenance Charges (OMC). Prior to 07.06.2007, the\n\ncharges were based purely on contract between the parties. In 2007, TRAI issued\n\nthe \"International Telecommunication Access to Essential Facilities at Cable\n\nLanding Stations Regulations 2007\" (2007 Regulations).      This introduced the\n\nrequirement of framing of Cable Landing Stations - Reference Interconnect Offer\n\n(RIO) to be calculated on cost based method. Such RIOs for all the three charges\n\nwere required to be submitted to TRAI, the Regulator for approval. This light-\n\ntouch regulation was operational till the 2007 Regulations were amended by\n\nAmendment Regulation, 2012 dated 19.10.2012. This amendment enabled TRAI\n\nto fix and specify the highest charges which could be realizable as per agreement\n\nbetween the parties.   On 21.12.2012, TRAI fixed all the three charges vide\n\nnotification which brought into effect the \"International Telecommunication\n\nLanding Station Access Facilities Charges and Co-Location Charges Regulations\n\n2012. The said Regulations (No.27 of 2012) contained 3 schedules of charges\n\nmade effective from 01.01.2013.",
            "4|Page",
            "4.    Regulations 3 and 4 made charging of all the three charges (AFC, O&M\n\ncharges and Co-location charges) strictly in the light of Schedules I, II and III on or\n\nafter 01.01.2013, as per next dated of payment. Regulation 5 classified that TRAI\n\nmay, from time to time, review and modify AFC and Co-location charges.",
            "5.    The Explanatory Memorandum (EM) to the Amendment Regulations of\n\n2012 (No.21 of 2012) dated 19.10.2012 makes it amply clear that service availers\n\nlike petitioners made a grievance that the charges for facilities of Cable Landing\n\nStations (CLS) are too high; with costs having reduced these need to be scaled\n\ndown. The owners of CLS (Tata and Airtel/ respondents) resisted the proposal but\n\nit is apparent that ceiling of the charges prescribed through the Schedules to the\n\nAmendment Regulations effective from 01.01.2013 were lower and not liked by\n\nthe respondents.",
            "6.    Both Tata and Airtel moved Hon'ble Madras High Court through Writ\n\nPetitions Nos.1875 and 3652 of 2013 respectively for appropriate remedies by\n\nchallenging the 2007 Regulations as well as Regulations Nos. 21 and 27 of 2012.\n\nInterim stay became operational from 24.01.2013 but ended with dismissal of the\n\nWrit Petitions by Judgment dated 11.11.2016 by a learned Single Judge of Hon'ble\n\nMadras High Court.",
            "5|Page",
            "7.    But in the intra-Court Appeals Tata and Bharti got relief as the appeals were\n\npartly allowed by judgment of the Division Bench dated 02.02.2018. It upheld the\n\nRegulations and the power of TRAI to prescribe the rates/charges which could be\n\nrealized by the owners of CLS from the service providers/access seekers. But the\n\nrates prescribed through Schedules I, II and III were quashed on the finding that\n\n\"utilization factor being taken as 70% and the conversion factor being fixed at 2.6\"",
            "8.    The 3 aggrieved parties, Reliance Communications Ltd., The Association of\n\nCompetitive Telecom Operators and TRAI preferred SLPs in the Hon'ble Supreme",
            "6|Page\n Court against the Division Bench judgment dated 02.07.2018. The SLPs were\n\ndisposed of by a very brief order dated 08.10.2018. Only the time given to TRAI,\n\ni.e., six months was reduced to six weeks from the date of Supreme Court's order\n\nto rework the figures in respect of both the factors as required by the findings of\n\nthe Division Bench. No interference was made on the merits of the matter. All the\n\ncontentions of both the sides were kept open. The parties were debarred from\n\ntaking adjournment, obviously because TRAI was given a short time of six weeks\n\nwith obligation to consider all the contentions of both the sides.",
            "9.    TRAI started the process for redoing and re-enacting the quashed schedules\n\nin a transparent and fair manner in consonance with principles of natural justice by\n\nissuing a Consultation Paper on 18.10.2019 and ultimately completed the exercise\n\nby notification and publication of the \"International Telecommunication Cable\n\nLanding Stations Access Facilitation Charges and Co-location Charges\n\n(Amendment) Regulations, 2018\" (2018 Regulations) on 28.11.2018.              These\n\nRegulations are in exercise of powers underSection 36read with several sub-\n\nclauses of clause (b) of sub-section (1) ofSection 11of the Telecom Regulatory\n\nAuthority of India Act, 1997(TRAI Act) as clearly indicated in the notification.\n\nThese contain only 2 regulations made to amend the Regulation No.27 of 2012.\n\nRegulation 1provides the nomenclature noticed above and that these shall come",
            "7|Page\n into force from the date of publication in the Gazette, i.e., 28.11.2018. Regulation",
            "- 2 provides the new Schedules - I, II and III with a declaration that these shall\n\n\"substitute\" the three respective schedules in the Regulation No.27 of 2012.",
            "10.   The response of Reliance Jio to the Consultation Paper of TRAI is Annexure\n\nP-11. As a part of general comments, in paragraph 7 a categorical request was\n\nmade to TRAI to specify the date of effect of new schedules that would be re-\n\nenacted, from 01.01.2013 because on that date the relevant Regulations of 2012\n\nhad become effective (along with the quashed schedules). But in the Amendment\n\nRegulations of 2018 TRAI has refrained from providing any separate date for the\n\nschedules to come into effect. The new schedules coming as substitutes are part of\n\nthe Amendment Regulations which are stated to be effective from dated of\n\nnotification, i.e., 28.11.2018.",
            "11.   The Explanatory Memorandum (EM) to the 2018 Regulations discloses that\n\nTRAI was conscious that the earlier Schedules I, II and III of 2012 stood quashed\n\nalready. Also, both the factors were redone but their values have remained the\n\nsame as originally determined for the old quashed schedules. So, on redoing the\n\nschedules, the rates have remained the same against which the owners of CLS had\n\nearlier preferred the writ petitions in 2013. But presently they have not leveled any",
            "8|Page\n challenge to the schedules brought in through the 2018 Regulations. The EM\n\nexplains that the rates in the schedules are only as the ceiling rates capable of being\n\nnegotiated downwards, as per the market forces. It also appears that some new\n\nCable Landing Stations of others had also come up in the meanwhile.",
            "12.   The petitioners have not questioned the legality of the 2018 Regulations.\n\nThey have sought the follow reliefs:-",
            "(Respondent No.2) to refund to the Petitioner a sum of INR 20.43\n\n      Crores (being INR 13.11 Crores refund amount + INR 7.32 Crores\n\n      interest calculated @18% p.a. till 13.02.2019) being the difference\n\n      between the substantially higher amounts recovered by Respondent\n\n                                                                    11 | P a g e\n              No.2 from the Petitioner towards Access Facilitation Charges, Co-\n\n             location Charges and Operation and Maintenance Charges for the\n\n             period 01.01.2013 to 11.11.2016, at the rates prevalent under the\n\n             Cable Landing Station - Reference Interconnect Offer regime of the\n\n             International Telecommunication Access to Essential facilities at\n\n             Cable Landing Stations Regulations, 2007, and the rates as specified\n\n             under Schedules I, II and III as notified vide the International\n\n             Telecommunication Cable Landing Stations Access Facilitation\n\n             Charges and Co-location Charges (Amendment) Regulations, 2018,\n\n             along with interest pendente lite and future interest thereon at 18%\n\n             (eighteen percent per annum) until the date of realization;",
            "(vi)   Grant such other or further relief(s) to the Petitioner, as may be\n\n             deemed just and appropriate by this Hon'ble Tribunal in the facts of\n\n             the case.\"",
            "13.   Clearly, the main prayer is No. (i), seeking a declaration/direction that 2018\n\nRegulations shall apply to parties with effect from 01.01.2013, i.e., the effective\n\ndate of the Regulation No.27 of 2012. Only if this No.(i) relief is granted, other\n\nreliefs may follow as a consequence. Hence, this is the principal issue of law\n\nrequiring an answer for disposal of all the 3 petitions.",
            "12 | P a g e",
            "14.   From the facts pleaded and even from the prayers in the petition it is evident\n\nthat for the period 01.01.2013 till 27.11.2018, the interregnum between the\n\neffective date of Regulation No.27 of 2012 and till coming into effect of the 2018\n\nRegulations, the parties maintained business relationship and access to CLSs were\n\ngranted on the basis of agreements providing for the RIO rates prevailing under the\n\n2007 Regulations. This was largely due to an interim order of stay by the Madras\n\nHigh Court on 24.01.2013 based on an undertaking that if Tata and Airtel would be\n\nfound liable to pay back any amount, they would do so. After the judgment of\n\nlearned Single Judge dated 11.11.2016, owners continued to raise bills at old rates\n\nbut some of the access seekers like Reliance Jio did not pay. The uncertainty has\n\ncontinued even post Division Bench judgment dated 02.07.2018.             With the\n\nnotification of 2018 Regulations on 28.11.2108, the 3 new schedules certainly\n\noccupy the field and govern the 3 charges from 28.11.2018 but the rival claims for\n\nrefund and demand of dues relating to the interregnum are entirely dependent upon\n\nthe main issue already noticed.",
            "15.   It is pertinent to also note that post 2018 Regulations the Association of\n\nCompetitive Telecom Operators, one of the petitioners moved the Hon'ble\n\nSupreme Court for seeking a clarification that when the same old rates have been\n\n\n                                                                          13 | P a g e\n re-notified by TRAI, it should not mean that the members would have to pay at the\n\nearlier prevailing higher rates for the between 2012 and 2018. That issue was, by\n\norder dated 28.09.2019 sent to this Tribunal and parties were permitted to raise\n\nwhatever pleas may be available in law. That order of the Apex Court has made\n\nthe main issue in these petitions still clearer. Some of the petitions were filed\n\nsubsequent to above order of 28.09.2019.",
            "16.      Later, Tata and Airtel took steps for realization of amounts, which they\n\nclaimed to be outstanding towards the charges on the basis of agreements/RIO\n\nrates. Petitioners sought stay of such demands/coercive action. The Tribunal\n\ndeclined to grant interim relief by its order passed on 07.11.2019. Reliance Jio\n\npreferred a writ petition against the above order before Hon'ble Madras High\n\nCourt.     The said W.P. No.32128 of 2019 was disposed of on 14.11.2019,\n\napparently in view of Reliance Jio agreeing to furnish Bank Guarantee for the\n\nentire claim which shall abide by the final order of this Tribunal. For final order a\n\ntime frame was indicated. Airtel was directed not to effect disconnection till final\n\nadjudication. All the issues were left open to be decided by this Tribunal.",
            "17.      The relevant facts and background having been noticed, now the dispute\n\nneeds to be adjudicated by considering the rival submissions.",
            "14 | P a g e",
            "18.   On behalf of petitioners arguments were led by Mr. Venkataraman, Senior\n\nAdvocate. Their stand is that - (i) since the parent Regulations of 2012(No.27 of\n\n2012) has not been declared ultra vires, the quashing of schedules alone does not\n\ninterfere with the continued effect of those Regulations from 01.01.2013; (ii) The\n\nabsence of schedules that got quashed till their re-enactment with effect from\n\n28.11.2018 would be immaterial because the new schedules would be retroactive\n\nfrom 01.01.2013 in the light of Regulations No.27 of 2012; (iii) the retroactivity of\n\nthe new re-enacted schedules is evident from the word \"substituted\" used by TRAI\n\nin the amendment Regulations of 2018, while re-enacting the new schedules in\n\nplace of the quashed schedules; (iv) sound principles of interpretation of statutes\n\nrequire that the new schedules be held retroactive so as to avoid any vacuum in the\n\noperation of parent Regulation No.27 of 2012 during the interregnum, to ensure\n\njustice to petitioners and to prevent unjust enrichment of Tata and Airtel; and (v)\n\nthe order by the Division Bench of High Court keeping the parent Regulations\n\nNo.27 of 2012 in abeyance for the period of six months granted for redoing and re-\n\nenacting the schedules was to ensure that the new schedules are effective from\n\n01.01.2013.",
            "15 | P a g e",
            "19.    On behalf of petitioners in T.P. No.78 of 2019 the above submissions were\n\nadopted. Additionally it was submitted thatRegulation 3of the parent Regulations\n\nof 2012 is like charging provision in a fiscal statute and the schedules are mere\n\ncomputation/machinery provisions hence when only the schedules were quashed,\n\nthese inferior provisions can not affect the operations of main charging provisions\n\nfrom the due date i.e., 01.01.2013. Hence, the new schedules, regardless of the\n\ndate of their re-enactment shall be retroactive from 01.01.2013.       It was also\n\ncontended that when the dispute arose in 2013, the rights of the parties need to be\n\nsettled from that period without leaving vacuum. Lastly, it was emphasized that if\n\nthe Association succeeds in this case, then its members also should be granted all\n\nthe reliefs.",
            "20.    On behalf of petitioner in T.P. No.2 of 2020 also its learned counsel adopted\n\nthe submissions in the lead matter. Further, he relied upon the undertaking of\n\nAirtel and other petitioner before the High Court to submit that on dismissal of the\n\nwrit petitions, the undertaking should have been honoured by making refund\n\nregardless of further proceedings through appeals. Lastly he urged that petitioners\n\ndeserve to get reliefs to avoid unnecessary hardship when the parent Regulations\n\nsurvived the challenge. Hence to avoid further continuation of mischief addressed\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          16 | P a g e\n by the parent Regulations, a declaration be made that the new Schedules of 2018\n\nare meant to be effective from 01.01.2013.",
            "21.   Before noticing the relevant case-laws cited on behalf of petitioners it will\n\nbe useful to notice the stand of respondents, particularly Tata and Airtel. Mr.Dave,\n\nlearned Senior Advocate has led the arguments on their behalf, assisted by learned\n\ncounsel for Airtel. Their stand is that: (i) This Tribunal being a creature of statute\n\ncannot grant a declaratory relief as sought through the prayers made by the\n\npetitioners; (ii) the parent Regulation No.27 of 2012 does not supersede the 2007\n\nRegulations and hence due to stay and subsequent quashing of the schedules of\n\nrates, the parties rightly conducted their business and commercial transactions\n\nduring the interregnum on the basis of the approved, cost based RIO charges as per\n\nthe 2007 Regulations; (iii) the mandate of the Regulations of 2012 in respect of\n\ncharges in the schedules could not be enforced in view of quashing of the\n\nschedules by the High Court and its confirmation by the Apex Court; (iv)sections\n\n36and37of the TRAI Act vest Regulation making power in TRAI but there is\n\nnothing to show that such power extends explicitly or by implication to making\n\nretrospective Regulations, henceRegulation 5in the Regulations No.27 of 2012\n\ncannot vest power to review the schedules retrospectively; (v) the RIO based\n\nagreements during the pendency of judicial proceedings, such as one of 2014, not\n\n                                                                            17 | P a g e\n under any dispute, there is no question of filling any vacuum during the\n\ninterregnum; (vi) once the schedules were quashed for not being in conformity\n\nwith requirements of transparency and natural justice, they became void leaving\n\nnothing which can legally be treated as valid and capable of being substituted with\n\neffect from 01.01.2013, hence such declaration cannot be granted; and (vii) the\n\ndeclaration sought by petitioners cannot be granted because ex facie the\n\nRegulations of 2018 along with the new schedules is effective only from\n\n28.11.2018, contrary to what Reliance Jio sought from TRAI and Regulations of\n\n2018 are admittedly not under challenge for a good reason that TRAI had no power\n\nto make these Regulations or the new schedules retrospective.",
            "22.   On behalf of Respondents it was pointed out that though the petitioners have\n\ntried to avoid in the prayers the word \"retrospective\", the main prayer in the\n\npetitions is for a declaration that the schedules in 2018 Regulations shall apply\n\nfrom an earlier date, i.e. 01.01.2013. This amounts to seeking a declaration that\n\nalthough these Regulations came into effect in 2018, the schedules contained\n\ntherein have retrospective effect from 01.01.2013. It was pointed out that in T.P.\n\nNo.78/2019, there are clear pleadings that as per agreements and RIO rates of 2007\n\npayments have been made by the members of the petitioner Association for the\n\nentire relevant period, till 27.11.2018. A prayer has been made for refund of the\n\n                                                                         18 | P a g e\n alleged differential amount along with interest without any challenge to the\n\nagreements that governed the interregnum.",
            "23.   Appearing for Airtel (Respondent No.2 in T.P. 78/2019), Mr. Gopal Jain,\n\nlearned Senior Advocate has further submitted that the pith and substance of the\n\nRegulation No.27 of 2012 was in the schedules specifying particular rates for\n\ndifferent charges. Once the schedules were quashed the said Regulation became\n\nunworkable and realizing the same TRAI was directed to redo and re-enact the\n\nschedules in 6 months. This was supplemented by the order to keep the earlier\n\nRegulations in abeyance for the entire six months period. This according to\n\nlearned counsel, was a clear indication by the Court that though part of the 2012\n\nRegulations was held intra vires, nothing was workable till new schedules could be\n\nreworked and redone. Hence, only a limited time was granted to TRAI to do the\n\nthings necessary to make the unworkable Regulations of 2012 again effective at\n\nthe earliest. He replied that formulation of tariffs or such rates by TRAI is not\n\nprocedural but an exercise of substance and therefore, law enjoins the duty of\n\nobserving effective consultation/hearing along with due transparency.       TRAI,\n\ntherefore, issued a fresh Consultation Process. Such an exercise was not needed if\n\nonly a clarificatory exercise was involved in re-enacting the schedules. The order\n\nof quashing had effaced the earlier schedules totally leaving nothing for\n\n                                                                        19 | P a g e\n clarification or a mere procedural exercise.      The case-laws, on the issue of\n\nretrospectivity/retroactivity cited by the petitioners were distinguished for these\n\nreasons as well.",
            "24.   Mr. Jain reiterated that the declaration sought by petitioners would amount\n\nto changing the date of enforcement of 2018 Regulations and this could not be\n\ndone within the jurisdiction available to this Tribunal. According to him, the\n\nprospective date chosen by TRAI was to provide certainty and prevent chaos\n\nbetween the parties. There was no vacuum as the parties had conducted their\n\nbusiness as per agreements which needed no disruption for the past transactions.\n\nHe also relied upon the judgments cited by Mr.Dave and explained the judgments\n\nrelied upon by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioners.",
            "25.   Appearing for Airtel, respondent No.2 in T.P. No.2 of 2020, Mr. Harsh\n\nKaushik, Advocate adopted the submissions on behalf of this respondent in the\n\nother two petitions. He was permitted to refer to T.P. No.77 of 2019 to point out\n\nthe relevant pleadings which show that against invoices raised by Airtel for Co-\n\nlocation charges on the basis of RIO based agreements, payments were made by\n\nReliance Jio, the petitioner in T.P. No.77/2019, even after the judgments of learned\n\nSingle Judge and also after that of the Division Bench of Madras High Court. In\n\n                                                                          20 | P a g e\n rejoinder the stand of the petitioner is that it had raised protests but made payments\n\nto avoid disconnection. But now it is entitled to refund because of new schedules\n\nof 2018 Regulation having effect from 01.01.2013.",
            "26.    Mr. Kaushik also pressed the counter claims preferred by Airtel in T.P. No.2\n\nof 2020 along with its reply on 29.01.2020 (of Respondent No.2). He pointed out\n\nthat the principal amount and interest claimed against the petitioner, totaling\n\nRs.62,12,512.85p is mentioned in Para 20 of the Reply-cum-Counter claim of\n\nRespondent No.2. The basis of the claim is RIO agreement as mentioned in Paras\n\n18 and 19. According to him, the claim has to be treated as admitted and allowed\n\naccordingly because the petitioner BSNL has not filed any rejoinder or reply to\n\ndeny it. Such stand of Respondent No.2 has been strongly opposed by Mr.Bhatia,\n\nlearned counsel for the petitioner. He also raised limitation against part of claims.\n\nMr.Bhatia relied on a judgment of Andhra Pradesh High Court inSri Rama\n\nMahal Vs. R. Rajasekhar; 2007(6) ALD 267 and Rule 5(2) ofOrder VIII of\n\nCPCto submit that even if there is no pleadings in denial, the court has a discretion\n\nto ask the plaintiff to prove its facts.",
            "27.    Since the counter claim involves issues of facts and there does not appear\n\nany specific mention of such claim in the earlier orders passed for expeditiously\n\n                                                                            21 | P a g e\n completing the pleadings in this petition, it is not in the interest of justice to allow\n\nthe counter claim only because no rejoinder or reply was filed by petitioner. In\n\nfact no rejoinder was filed even to the reply of Tata (Respondent No.1). This was\n\nobviously for lack of specific notice of the counter claim which has been included\n\nin the reply in a rather casual manner. This petition was admitted on 20.01.2020,\n\nthe very first day of listing and as per understanding among the parties that same\n\nissue is pending in two other petitions, a short time of one week was allowed for\n\nreply. Filing of rejoinder was also permitted within a short period. On the next\n\ndate, i.e. 27.01.2020, this petition was listed with other two petitions to expedite\n\nthe hearing of all the petitions having common issues, pending from before.\n\nHearing was fixed for 13.02.2020. In such circumstances, it will not be fair or\n\nproper to decide the counter claim without affording an effective opportunity to the\n\npetitioner BSNL to file a reply to the counter claim, if so required in the light of\n\ndecision on main common issues. This petition, therefore, shall be treated as\n\npending for deciding the counter claim at a later stage after the common judgment\n\nand in the light thereof.",
            "28.   In all the 3 petitions, the submissions on behalf of Tata is same as that of\n\nAirtel.",
            "22 | P a g e",
            "29.   On behalf of petitioners, Mr. Venkataraman has referred to 3 judgments to\n\nexplain in general the types of control which legislature usually provides in a\n\nstatute to exercise control over subordinate legislation; provide safeguards against\n\nexcessive delegation and against further delegation unless specifically provided in\n\nthe concerned statute. These case laws inAtlas Cycle Industries & Ors. Vs. State\n\nof Haryana; (1979) 2 SCC 196, BSNL Vs. TRAI; (2014) 3 SCC 222 and Lohia\n\nMachines Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Union of India & Ors.; (1985) 2 SCC 197 need no\n\nfurther deliberations.",
            "30.   His second set of case laws is of five Supreme Court judgments. He has\n\nrelied upon three - (i) Zile Singh Vs. State of Haryana; (2004) 8 SCC 1,",
            "(ii) Government of India Vs. Indian Tobacco Association; (2005) 7 SCC 396\n\nand (iii) Gottumukkala Venkata Krishnraju Vs. Union of India, 2018 SCC\n\nOnline SC 1386 to highlight the significance and meaning of the word\n\n\"substituted\" when used in a statute.According to submissions,Paras 23 to 25 of\n\nZile Singh(supra.),Paras 14, 15 and 26 of Indian Tobacco(supra.)and Para 13-\n\n16, 18, 19 and 22 ofGottumukkala(supra.) are relevant and make the law clear\n\nthat every statute is prima facie prospective unless made to operate retrospectively\n\nby express provision or by necessary implication. Substitution of a provision\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          23 | P a g e\n results in repeal of the earlier rule and bringing into its place the new rule. Thus, it\n\nis different from \"supersession\" of a rule.",
            "31.   He also referred, on the above principles of law, two judgments actually\n\ncited by respondents only to explain as to why these cannot help the case of Airtel\n\nor Tata.InITO Vs. Ponnoose; (1996) 2 SCC 351 the law enunciated in Para 5\n\nwas in the context of substitution of a definition clause. It brooks no caveat and in\n\nmost uncertain terms supports the case of Airtel & Tata that when a new law\n\naffects rights, the courts will not accept it as retrospective unless such intention of\n\nthe legislature is manifest from express words or necessary implication. A law by\n\na delegated statutory authority cannot have retrospective effect unless the power to\n\nmake retrospective laws is clear from the express language of the relevant statute\n\nor by necessary implication.",
            "The attempt to distinguish and dilute the aforesaid principles of binding\n\nauthority on the basis of discussions in para 7 of the same judgment cannot\n\nsucceed because in para 7 the Court itself explained that rules underArticle 309of\n\nthe Constitution stand on a different footing because the constitutional provisions\n\nsurroundingArticle 309render this rule making power plenary in nature till such\n\nservice rules are not replaced by an Act of a competent legislature.",
            "24 | P a g e",
            "32.In the other caseSri Vijaylakshmi Rice Mills Vs. State of A.P; (1976)\n\n3SCC 37 a new provision in an Amendment Order laying down a new price in\n\nPrice Control Order as a substitute for the price during the earlier period was\n\nclaimed as having retrospective effect. The Court repelled the submission by\n\nobserving in para 5 that no doubt the word \"substitute\" means \"to replace\" but the\n\nquestion is from which date the replacement of the new schedule took place. Since\n\nthere was no provision in the order to indicate retrospective effect, the normal rule\n\nwould make it effective only from date of notification. The Court further clarified\n\nthe law that \"The principle is also well settled that statutes should not be construed\n\nor impose new duties in respect of transactions which were complete at the time of\n\ntheAmending Actcame into force.\"",
            "Learned senior counsel for the petitioners has referred to the well recognized\n\nexceptions indicated in para 8 of this very judgment where the contention to accept\n\nthe new provision as explanatory or declaratory was taken up. It was accepted that\n\nas a legal principle the presumption against construing a legislation retrospective is\n\ninapplicable when the statute is passed for the purpose of supplying an obvious\n\nomissions in a former statute or to explain a former statute. (emphasis supplied).\n\nOn facts the Court held in para 9 that the Amendment Order was neither\n\nexplanatory nor declaratory of any obvious omission.",
            "25 | P a g e",
            "33.   A further submission was advanced by Mr. Venkataraman that the judgment\n\nin theITOcase (supra) cannot be applied to the Amendment Regulations of 2018\n\nprescribing the schedules because in the present case, the High Court (DB) has\n\nupheld the vires of the other provisions of earlier Regulations and had quashed\n\nonly the schedules.The judgment inVijalakshmi(supra) was sought to be\n\nexplained as inapplicable because, according to learned senior counsel, the facts\n\nnarrated in para 4 were peculiar and different than the facts of the present case.",
            "34.   The submissions noted above are unacceptable. The facts pointed out do not\n\nin any way dilute the force of law as clarified by the Apex Court. The word\n\n\"substitution\" in an amending statute cannot by itself affect the presumption\n\nagainst retrospective effect more so when, as in the case at hand, the amendment is\n\nneither explanatory nor declaratory but a new exercise for reworking the charges\n\ndue to one or more factors found to have been not considered in accordance with\n\nlaw and principles of natural justice. The law declared by the Apex Court that a\n\ndelegatee, unless clearly empowered by the statute, cannot enact subordinate\n\nlegislation having retrospective effect also does not get affected by facts of the\n\ncase. In the present case no attempt has been made, and rightly so, to contend thatTRAI Acthas vested such power to TRAI. There is no scope to make such a\n\nsubmission because there is no provision vesting power explicitly or by necessary\n\n                                                                            26 | P a g e\n implication to make Regulations with retrospective effect. Normally a regulatory\n\nauthority is not even expected to do so because it can unsettle the past transactions\n\namongst different service providers and can have devastating effects on the sector.",
            "35.   Since TRAI does not have the power to make Regulations with retrospective\n\neffect, it is not very material to consider the contention on behalf of the petitioner\n\nthat the schedules can have retroactive effect because they are merely procedural\n\nand do not affect the rights and liabilities of the parties concerned. But since such\n\nan issue has been raised, it is proper to decide it. The contention, ex-facie lacks\n\nmerits. The text and context in which the schedules have been enacted as a part of\n\nthe relevant Regulations of 2012 and re-enacted in 2018 after a successful assail by\n\nAirtel and Tata against the 2012 schedules permit no other finding than a firm\n\ndeclaration that the schedules are the heart and soul of the Regulations of 2012 as\n\nthey lay down the charges that govern the owners / operators of CLS as well as the\n\nother parties who avail the facilities of CLS. Clearly, the schedules have full\n\nimpact upon the rights and liabilities of the parties. They cannot be treated as\n\nprocedural or machinery provisions in the given context. The contrary stand of\n\nthe petitioners are therefore found unacceptable. The legal presumption against\n\nretrospective effect of schedules whether in 2012 Regulations or in the\n\nAmendment Regulations of 2018 has to be accepted as valid.",
            "27 | P a g e",
            "36.   The only significant controversy that requires immediate consideration\n\nbefore deciding the main issue, is whether there is anything in the text of 2018\n\nRegulations to dispel the presumption against its effect from 01.01.2013. The\n\neffect of the word \"substituted\" has been noticed earlier. It means - \"to replace\"",
            "37.   On behalf of petitioners, reliance has been placed upon as many as 6\n\njudgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court to support the submission that Amendment\n\nRegulations of 2018, specifically the new schedules incorporated therein need not\n\nonly an interpretation as to the date of schedules becoming effective but a\n\npurposive interpretation so as not to allow the 2007 Regulations any play and not\n\n                                                                          28 | P a g e\n to render the Regulations of 2012 unworkable till 27.11.2018.

Only if the text provides a choice\n\nbetween two interpretations, the Court has to prefer the one which saves its vires,\n\nthe workability and secures the purpose of its enactment. The High Court had\n\nmissed the clear text in clause 2 and had indulged in an interpretation which was\n\nfound unacceptable as it frustrated the purpose of the Order - to make provisions\n\nonly for the directly recruited A.Es.",
            "40.   The other judgments have not taken any different view. These only reiterate\n\nthe well known principles of interpretation of statutes that golden rule is to go by\n\nthe text when it is clear and does not brook of any different meaning.     But in a\n\ncontrary situation the entire context, legislative history, object and purpose of\n\nenactment etc. is required to be seen with a view to secure the intention of the\n\nlegislature and to save the workability and vires, if possible.",
            "41.   In the present case the text of the 2018 Regulations alone fall for\n\nconsideration as to whether it requires interpretation as claimed on behalf of the\n\npetitioners. The text is found to be clear and unambiguous and does not warrant\n\nany interpretation for making the schedules therein effective from any earlier date.\n\nMoreover, as discussed earlier, the regulator, TRAI has no power to make\n\nretrospective regulations.",
            "30 | P a g e",
            "42.   Once the earlier schedules in the 2012 Regulations failed to muster judicial\n\nscrutiny and were quashed, only the High Court or in appeal the Supreme Court\n\ncould have, if persuaded by good reasons, directed that whatever rates fir relevant\n\ncharges are re-determined by TRAI through new schedules would govern the\n\nparties as if effective from 01.01.2013 in place of the quashed schedules. This\n\nnature of final judgment between the parties could have also taken away the\n\ndefense of Airtel & Tata based upon agreements to take care of the charges during\n\nthe interregnum, based on RIO as per Regulations of 2007. Such agreements are\n\nnot under challenge. The High Court has not ordered for refund of any money paid\n\nto Tata or Airtel.",
            "43.   Due to quashing of the schedules, as discussed earlier, the Regulation No.27\n\nof 2012 havge been rendered ineffective till replacement schedules were enacted as\n\npart of 2018 Regulations effective from 28.11.2018. The High Court or Supreme\n\nCourt orders do not help the case of the petitioner and TRAI does not have power\n\nunder the statute(TRAI Act) to make the re-enacted schedules effective from any\n\nearlier date nor it has attempted to do so in spite of a request for that made on\n\nbehalf of Reliance Jio. The Amendment Regulations of 2018 laying down the\n\nreworked schedules are ex-facie effective only prospectively since the schedules\n\ndo not lay down mere procedure but prescribe rates for the charges and are bound\n                                                                         31 | P a g e\n to affect the rights and liabilities of the parties as is apparent even from the reliefs\n\nsought in these petitions, this Tribunal has no option but to conclude that\n\npetitioners case for declaring the new schedules enacted in 2018 as effective from\n\n01.01.2013, has no merits.",
            "44.   The respondents, Airtel & Tata have relied not only on the judgments in the\n\ncase ofITO(supra) andSri Vijaylakshmi(supra) which have been discussed\n\nearlier because learned senior counsel for the petitioner cited them for the purpose\n\nof distinguishing them as inapplicable, though unsuccessfully.For the same\n\npurpose, he has dealt with two more judgments - (i) Syniverse Technologies\n\n(India) Pvt Ltd. Vs. TRAI, by Hon'ble Delhi High Court (2019) SCC Online\n\nDel 6430 and (ii) CIT Vs. B.C. Srinivasa Setty (1981) 2 SCC 460.",
            "45.   In the case of Syniverse Technologies a review petition before Delhi High\n\nCourt filed on behalf of Reliance Jio was pressed inter-alia, on the ground that\n\nwhile setting aside the PPT charges of Rs.4.00, the High Court failed to issue\n\nnecessary consequential order to direct TRAI to rework the PPT charges for the\n\nperiod the quashed amendment was in force. To support this plea, reliance was\n\nplaced upon the same Division Bench judgment of Madras High Court dated\n\n02.07.2018 passed in favour of Tata as upheld by the Supreme Court on\n\n                                                                             32 | P a g e\n 18.10.2018. The Delhi High Court, in para 7, held that:- \"The Division Bench of\n\nthe Madras High Court, expressly permitted TRAI to proceed and frame\n\nRegulations in accordance with law. The Supreme Court has endorsed that view.\n\nThis, in our opinion, does not in any manner imply that the Court authorized TRAI\n\nto frame retrospective Regulations of the kind that the Review Petitioner is\n\nseeking.\" The review petition was dismissed. Nothing material was placed to\n\ndistinguish the aforequoted views of Delhi High (DB) as to the import of Madras\n\nHigh Court (DB) judgment and the limitations of TRAI in making Regulations\n\nwith retrospective effect.",
            "46.In the case ofCIT Vs. B.C. Srinivasa Setty, in the context ofSection 45of\n\nthe Income Tax Act (IT Act) the Court was considering whether \"goodwill\" is\n\nincluded in the expression \"Capital asset\". That judgment is not of relevance\n\nexcept that for interpreting the meaning of that expression, the Court held that it\n\nmust enquire whether contextually section 45 excludes goodwill.Section 34was\n\nthe charging section, but the computation provisions were read with the same after\n\nobserving that these together constitute an integrated code.",
            "47.   It has been submitted by learned senior counsel Mr. Venkataraman for the\n\npetitioners that in the present case the facts and provisions under consideration are\n\nentirely different, therefore the principles of charging and machinery or\n\n                                                                           33 | P a g e\n computation provisions are not apt / relevant. This comment is correct, although\n\nMr. Mehta, learned senior counsel has laboured to urge thatRegulation 3of the\n\nRegulation No.27 of 2012 is charging section and is therefore unaffected by the\n\nrates of charges being re-enacted later in 2018.       This aspect has been found\n\nunacceptable earlier when in the context it has been held that the schedules are not\n\nsimple procedures, they prescribe rates and affect the rights and obligations of the\n\nparties.",
            "48.    Mr. Mehta, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner Association\n\n(T.P No.78 of 2019) has highlighted the meaning of \"substitution\" by again\n\nreferring to various paragraphs, particularly para 15 in the case ofGovernment of\n\nIndia Vs. Indian Tobacco Association(supra).          That judgment related to an\n\nexemption notification under theCustoms Act, 1962, which had left out certain\n\nplaces / ports / depot. On representation, those were included by using the word\n\n\"substitution\" through an amendment notification. The Courts accepted that the\n\namendment was clarificatory, it did not take away vested rights of any party and\n\nbeing an exemption notification, it deserved the beneficent construction.          In\n\nparagraph 26 it was clarified that the word \"substitution\" may be construed also as\n\nan amendment having a prospective effect, depending upon the context. This\n\naspect does not improve the case of the petitioners.",
            "34 | P a g e",
            "49.   Mr. Mehta also relied upon the case ofZile Singh(supra) which has already\n\nbeen discussed in detail. He pointed out that this judgment has been followed in\n\nthe case of Gottumukkala Venkata Krishamraju, A 2018 SC4197. In this case\n\nthe amendment was by \"substitution\" but only prospective as it was made\n\napplicable only to those serving on the date of amendment. It did not affect rights\n\nof any other party and only conferred benefits to serving Presiding Officers.He\n\nplaced reliance also upon two more judgments : (i) Citibank N.A. Vs. Hiten P\n\nDalal & Ors; (2016)1 SCC 411; & (ii) Welfare Association A.R.P Vs. Ranjeet\n\nGohil & another; (2003)9 SCC 358. The case of Citibank related to principles\n\ngoverning grant of restitution in the context of section 144 of Civil Procedure\n\nCode. The present case does not involve any claim by way of restitution. The case\n\nof Welfare Association, in para 25 that has been relied upon, only reiterates the\n\nwell established principle of interpretation that Court should, if possible, lean in\n\nfavour of validating a law. Judgments to this effect have already been considered.\n\nThese principles must have been canvassed also before the Madras High Court\n\n(DB) which still preferred to quash the part of Regulation No.27 of 2012 which\n\nconsisted of the schedules containing the rates. At the present stage of lis, these\n\nprinciples of interpretation are not of much help. Mr. Mehta also explained the\n\nmeaning of \"kept in abeyance\" as \"in state of suspension or inactivity\". There is\n\n\n                                                                          35 | P a g e\n no dispute on this aspect. |But how it would confer retrospectivity upon the new\n\nschedules of 2018 has not been shown at all.",
            "50.   In course of reply, Mr. Dave has placed reliance on the judgments which\n\nhave been noticed earlier because these were sought to be explained by learned\n\ncounsel for the petitioner but without success. These are - (i) ITO Vs. M.C.\n\nPoonnose(supra); (ii)Sri Vijaylakshmi Rice Mills(supra); and (iii)Synerverse\n\nTechnologies (supra). In ITO, he emphasized paras 5 and 6 to substantiate the\n\nsubmission that TRAI cannot enact Regulations having retrospective effect. This is\n\na sound proposition and has to be accepted.In support he has also cited case ofHukum Chand Vs. Union of India; (1972) 2 SCC 601. Paras 7 and 8 reiterate\n\nthe same principles of law.To similar effect is the judgment inStrawboard\n\nManufacturing Co. Ltd. Vs. Gutta Mill Workers' Union, A1953 SC 95.",
            "51.   The judgments in Sri Vijaylakshmi and        Syniverse Technologies have\n\nalready been discussed. These also have not been distinguished or explained on\n\nmaterial aspects and fully support the plea of Mr. Dave that the word \"substitute\"\n\ndoes not always imply retrospective substitution and in the facts and context it\n\ncannot be anything but prospective. In the Syniverse case, the Delhi High Court\n\n(DB) has categorically held that the Madras judgment (DB) and its endorsement by\n\n                                                                        36 | P a g e\n the Supreme Court does not show that TRAI could redo fresh schedules with\n\nretrospective effect.",
            "52.In support of the proposition that if decision or regulation is quashed for\n\nbeing in violation of Natural Justice, then the effect is to render the same void,\n\nreliance was placed on the judgment in the case ofNawabkhan Abbaskhan Vs.\n\nThe State of Gujarat. Para 18 of the judgment, in the last two sentences supports\n\nthe above plea. Such an order, even if void in the limited sense, is \"liable to be\n\navoided by Court with retroactive force\".            This judgment has not been\n\ndistinguished or explained by the other side. The law is otherwise also clear that\n\nwhen a declaration is made by a Court that a particular rule / law is bad leading to\n\nits being quashed, the judgment operates retroactively granting complete relief\n\nunless the Court, for reasons makes it only prospective. The Madras High Court\n\n(DB) has not restricted its judgment for only prospective operation and therefore it\n\nclearly does not help the case of the petitioners.",
            "53.   It is unacceptable that although TRAI cannot make Regulations having\n\nretrospective effect, it can achieve the same very purpose by strength of any of the\n\nprovisions in the Regulations of 2012 that were made by TRAI within the same\n\nlimitation flowing from theTRAI Act.         This plea, which is sheet anchor of\n\n                                                                          37 | P a g e\n petitioners' case has no merits and cannot be accepted. Only to avoid any\n\nsemblance of conflict, the Madras High Court (DB) appears to have put the\n\nunquashed part of 2012 Regulations in abeyance, to enable TRAI to re-enact the\n\nreworked schedules in accordance with law.              It could not be to confer\n\nretrospectivity to the new schedules.       For that purpose an explicit order was\n\nnecessary. Nothing of substance remains for adjudication. But the case laws cited\n\nby Mr. Jain and Mr. Malhotra, senior advocates who have appeared for Airtel &\n\nTata in the tagged petitions are indicated hereinafter in brief.",
            "54.   Mr. Jain relied upon -Union of India Vs. Deoki Nandan Agggarwal, 1992\n\nSupp(1) SCC 323 for the proposition that it is not within th domain of Courts to\n\nrewrite legislative policy and hence TRAI was asked to do its work of redoing the\n\nschedules because the earlier schedules were quashed for good.He also relied\n\nupon -Panchi Devi Vs. State of Rajasthan, (2009) 2 SCC 589 in support of the\n\nprinciple that a delegated legislation is ordinarily prospective in nature; right or\n\nliability which is created for the first time cannot be given retrospective effect. He\n\nreferred to some of the case laws already cited by Mr. Dave. He showed that post\n\nthe Syniverse judgment, TRAI issued an amendment Regulations on 30.9.2019 and\n\nmade the fresh PPT charge effective from 11.11.2019.Additionally, he relied\n\nuponCollector, C&C.E Vs. Oriental Timber Industries(1985) 3SCC 85,\n\n                                                                            38 | P a g e\n wherein, while allowing the appeal of Union of India,          only to avoid undue\n\nhardship to the assessee, the notices were directed to be applied only for the future.\n\nThis does not appear relevant except to highlight that only for prospective effect of\n\na judgment, specific order is required to be passed.",
            "55.    Mr Malhotra has adopted the submissions advanced on behalf of Airtel and\n\nhas pointed out that in EM to a notification dated 8.6.2005, TRAI admitted that it\n\nhas no power to issue regulations with retrospective effect but was doing so in that\n\nmatter due to a direction of TDSAT. He has relied upon (2013) 15 SCC (State of\n\nRajasthan Vs. Basant Agrotech India Ltd.) to highlight inherent limitations on\n\nthe power to make delegated legislation, particularly in fiscal matters (Paras 21-",
            "24).",
            "56.    On behalf of Airtel and Tata it has rightly been submitted that in fact there\n\nwas no vacuum during the interregnum and the effect of quashing of schedules by\n\nHigh Court cannot be avoided by giving retrospective effect to the 2018\n\nRegulations and schedules thereunder. Also no case of unjust enrichment is made\n\nout against them. Market driven prices have been realized by the parties and even\n\nif it is presumed that some refund is payable, the amount will not reach those\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           39 | P a g e\n ultimate users who paid the prices demanded by the petitioners during the\n\ninterregnum to meet the charges as per agreed rates.",
            "57.   In the final analysis, it is reiterated that this Tribunal has a limited issue to\n\ndecide and in view of discussions made and findings recorded earlier in this\n\njudgment, it is held that petitioners cannot be granted the relief of declaration that\n\nthe re-enacted schedules that are part of Amendment Regulations notified on\n\n28.11.2018 are effective from an earlier date, i.e., 01.01.2013. As a result the\n\nprayers for consequential reliefs such as for refund and interest etc. also fail. All\n\nthe three petitions are dismissed for lack of merits. But as indicated earlier,\n\nT.P.No.02 of 2020 shall be listed later only for considering the counter-claim as\n\nper law.",
            "58.   Before parting with the order, it is recorded that the petitions were argued\n\nand heard only on the relevant questions of law except a counter-claim in T.P.No.2\n\nof 2020.    In the written notes of submissions by Reliance Jio some additional\n\nissues of facts, apparently to question the correctness of accounts and demands by\n\nthe CLS owner / operator have been introduced towards the end. Those cannot be\n\ngone into in the present proceedings in view of limited issues raised and argued.\n\nSuch attempt is not appreciated.",
            "40 | P a g e",
            "59.   Since the claims in the petitions stand dismissed, the interim orders shall\n\ncease to operate in favour of petitioners, particularly in T.P.

            "Written bycompetitionlaw•December 7, 2018•3:58 pm•Antitrust,News and Events",
            "The Supreme Court of India, by a recentjudgement dated 5thDecember 2018, while dismissing the appeals filed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI ) and Reliance JIO and by upholding theBombay High Court (“High Court”) judgment dated 21stSeptember 2017which had quashed the CCIprima facieorder directing investigation under section 26(1) of the Competition Act,2002 (the Act)  against Bharti Airtel, Vodafone , Idea ( “existing telecom players”) and the trade association , the  Cellular Operators Association of India ( COAI)   has deftly found a middle path and resolved the long debated tussle for supremacy between the overarching fair market watchdog, the CCI and the sector specific regulators , the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), in this case, by postponing scrutiny into any possible co-ordination or collusion between the existing telecom players through the platform of COAI or otherwise .",
            "Further, the Apex Courts , while upholding its earlier much celebrated judgment in the Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) case[1](SAIL Case) on the nature of the CCIprima facieorder under section 26(1) of the Act ( administrative and not quasi-judicial as contended by the existing telecom players) has also , for the first time , made a distinction between examination of competition issues  by CCI in a sector having a statutory regulator and a sector without one.  The Court has invoked the need for use of section 21A of the Act, which makes it mandatory for CCI to obtain opinion of the sector regulator on sector specific issues first .",
            "The Apex court has accordingly held that until the jurisdictional facts ( the “technical issues” pertaining to contentious point of connection, interconnection charges , point of interconnection etc. between existing telecom players and reliance Jio) are decided by TRAI , CCI can not proceed to investigate any possible coordination between the existing telecom players . The Court , however, rejected the contention of the existing telecom players that CCIs jurisdiction is completely ousted in cases where a statutory regulator (TRAI in this case) exists .",
            "BACKGROUND",
            "In exercise of powers under Section 13 r/w Section 11 of the TRAI Act, the TRAI issued direction dated 7thJune, 2005 to all the telecom service providers to provide interconnection[2]within 90 days of the applicable payments made by the interconnection seeker. On October 21, 2013, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (Reliance Jio) was granted Unified License and Unified Access Service License under Section 4 of the Telegraph Act, 1885 by the Department of Telecom (DoT) for providing telecommunication services in all 22 circles in India. Reliance Jio executed interconnection agreements with the existing telecom operators viz. Bharti Airtel Ltd. (“Airtel”), Idea Cellular Ltd. (“Idea”) and Vodafone India Ltd. (“Vodafone”) [collectively referred as Incumbent Dominant Operators- IDOs in the judgment ]",
            "Reliance Jio, vide letter dated 21stJune 2016, requested the IDOs to augment Point of interconnection (POI) for access, National Long Distance (NLD) and International Long Distance (ILD) services, as the capacity already provided to it was causing huge POI congestion, resulting in call failures on its network. According to Reliance Jio, the IDOs intentionally ignored the aforesaid request, and Reliance Jio issued a letter to TRAI, following which TRAI had to intervene and it heard the grievances on both sides. IDOs’ grievances basically being focused on free calls being offered by Reliance Jio as a test run which led to an unprecedented traffic congestion on their respective networks.",
            "Soon thereafter, In September 2016,  one Mr. Rajan Sardana filed information before the Competition Commission of India (“CCI”) and similar application was filed by  one Justice K.A Puj (Retd.). Subsequently, an information was filed by Reliance Jio itself before the CCI alleging cartelization amongst the IDOs and Cellular Operators Association of India (“COAI”), by causing delay/denying (i) the provisioning of POIs to Reliance Jio, (ii) Mobile Number Portability requests of customers who wanted to switch to Jio (iii) also, COAI was acting on behest of the IDOs against the interest of Reliance Jio.",
            "As the matter was with TRAI as well, TRAI issued recommendations to DoT  after finding that IODs have violated conditions under the Standard of Quality of Service of Basic Telephone Service(Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Service Regulations,2009 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘QoS’), interconnection agreements and Unified License. TRAI recommended that a fine of Rs. 50 crore as per local service area be imposed on the IDOs for not adhering to TRAI norms and regulations. On the other hand, CCI took cognizance of the three above-mentioned informations filed before it which were registered as Case No. 81, 83 and 95 of 2016 and passed an Order dated 21stApril, 2017 under Section 26(1) of the Act directing investigation by the DG into alleged cartelization amongst the IDOs (“prima facie order”).",
            "Writ Petitions were filed immediately by the IDOs against the said prima facie order challenging the jurisdiction of CCI as the matter fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of another regulatory authority- TRAI.",
            "BOMBAY HIGH COURT DECISION",
            "In a nutshell, the judgement of the High Court dated 21stSeptember 2017 held that insofar as contracts, license issues, quality of services, interconnection agreements etc. which are regulated  by the TRAI Act are concerned, as the first instance, it is the authority of TRAI to decide these questions. Once there is a determination of the respective rights and obligations under these licenses by the authority under the TRAI Act, only thereafter the CCI gets jurisdiction to go into the questions of anti-competitive practices. In other words, thejurisdictional factsare to be decided by the authorities under the TRAI Act which has exclusive jurisdiction to determine those issues as the TRAI is the statutory authority established for this very purpose, and unless there is determination of these facts, the machinery under the Competition Act, 2002 cannot be invoked.",
            "The High court, therefore, holding that it was premature for the CCI to entertain the Information filed before it, quashed the CCI’s prima facie order.",
            "SUPREME COURT DECISION",
            "The Supreme Court, in its decision dated 5thDecember 2018, framed  three issues which were raised before it, as formulated below:",
            "The Supreme Court before determining the issue, undertook a careful analysis of the provision of the Act and TRAI Act, 1997 and arrived at the conclusion that the functioning of the telecom companies which are granted license under Section 4 of the Telegraph Act, 1885 is regulated by the provision contained in the TRAI Act. The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that, in the instant case, dispute raised by Reliance Jio is that the IDOs have not given POIs as per the license conditions resulting into non-compliance and have failed to ensureinter aliatechnical compatibility thereby. In addition, not only has Reliance Jio raised this dispute, it has specifically approached TRAI for settlement and TRAI is seized of this particular dispute. TRAI being a specialized sectoral regulator and also armed with sufficient power to ensure fair, non-discriminatory and competitive market in the telecom sector, is better suited to decide the current issue.",
            "The Hon’ble Supreme Court, therefore, agreed with the findings of the High Court that till the jurisdictional issues are straightened and answered by the TRAI, the CCI is ill equipped to proceed in the matter.",
            "However, it is pertinent to note that the Hon’ble Supreme Court did not totally oust the jurisdiction of CCI. The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that even if TRAI returns a finding that a particular activity was anti-competitive, its powers would be limited to the action that can be taken under the TRAI Act alone, and if such activities offend the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002, the consequences under that Act would also follow.",
            "In totem, since the matter pertains to the telecom sector which is specifically regulated by the TRAI Act, balance is maintained by permitting TRAI in the first instance to deal with and decide the jurisdictional aspects which can be more competently handled by it. Once that exercise is done and there are finding returned by TRAI which lead to theprima facieconclusion that IDOs have indulged in anti-competitive practices, CCI can be activated to investigate the matter.Therefore , the Hon’ble  Supreme Court in its decision, does not bar the jurisdiction of CCI altogether but only pushes it to a later stage, after the TRAI has undertaken necessary exercise in the first place.",
            "The Hon’ble Supreme Court although, while upholding its earlier decision in theSAIL caseacknowledged  that the order passed under Section 26(1) of the Act, is administrative (and not quasi- judicial) in nature, held that the Writ petitions were still maintainable since the jurisdictional issues raised before it could only have been examined under the extraordinary powers of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution .",
            "The Hon’ble Supreme Court observed that as it has acknowledged that the order under Section 26(1) of the Act is administrative in nature, the High Court would not be competent to adjudge the validity of such an order on merits. However, since the Hon’ble Supreme Court is upholding the order of the High court with respect to the jurisdictional conflict, the ultimate decision of the High court quashing the CCI’s order under Section 26(1) of the Act is not liable to be interfered.",
            "Comment: This is undoubtedly another landmark judgment from Justice AK Sikri . This judgment assumes significance because,Firstly-The Hon’ble Supreme Court has finally shown a middle path to resolve the long-debated issue of  jurisdictional conflict between the CCI and sector regulators . The Hon’ble Supreme Court, by invoking the doctrine of harmonious construction has balanced the stand by giving TRAI the power to determine the rights and obligations of the parties first, and then if it apprehends the existence of anti-competitive act, invokes the jurisdiction of CCI. In coming to this conclusion , the Apex Court has , without making a special reference, followed the existing jurisprudence on this issue in the USA , illustrated in the noted cases of Credit Suisse Case[3]and the Verizon Communications  case[4]decided by the US Supreme Court;Secondly– the Hon’ble Supreme Court while upholding its earlier much celebrated judgment in the Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) case[5](SAIL Case) on the nature of the CCI prima facie order under section 26(1) of the Act ( administrative and not quasi-judicial as contended by the existing telecom players) has also , for the first time , made a distinction between examination of competition issues  by CCI in a sector having a statutory regulator and a sector without one;Thirdly,the Hon’ble Court has not ruled out the possibility of co-ordination between the existing telecom players to challenge the maverick business model of Reliance Jio and has ,therefore left the determination of such competition issues open by CCI subsequent to the determination on the technical issues by TRAI.",

            "The Telecom Industry in India has undergone a remarkable transformation since the country’s independence in 1947. From a state-controlled monopoly to a vibrant, competitive marketplace, the industry has evolved significantly, particularly in the last three decades. This evolution has been guided and shaped by a robust regulatory framework, spearheaded by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). This report delves into the intricate web of regulations, laws, and landmark cases that have defined the telecom landscape in India.",
            "The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) was established on 20th February 1997 through an Act of Parliament known as the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997. The creation of TRAI marked a watershed moment in the history of Indian telecommunications, signaling the government’s intent to transition from being an operator to a regulator in this critical sector.",
            "The TRAI Act, 1997, in its preamble, clearly outlines the purpose of the regulatory body:",
            "“An Act to provide for the establishment of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India and the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal to regulate the telecommunication services, adjudicate disputes, dispose of appeals and to protect the interests of service providers and consumers of the telecom sector, to promote and ensure orderly growth of the telecom sector and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.”",
            "This comprehensive mandate empowered TRAI to oversee various aspects of the telecom sector, including tariff regulation, interconnection matters, quality of service standards, and the promotion of competition. The Act also established the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) to adjudicate disputes and handle appeals against TRAI’s decisions.",
            "One of TRAI’s primary responsibilities is to ensure fair and transparent tariff structures in the telecom sector. The regulator has the authority to fix tariffs for various telecom services. For instance, in 1999, TRAI introduced the Telecommunication Tariff Order, which set the framework for tariff regulation in the sector.",
            "The Telecommunication Tariff Order, 1999, states:",
            "“The Authority may, from time to time, by order, notify in the Official Gazette the rates at which the telecommunication services within India and outside India shall be provided under this Act including the rates at which messages shall be transmitted to any country outside India.”",
            "This provision has allowed TRAI to intervene when necessary to protect consumer interests and ensure fair competition. For example, in 2016, TRAI introduced regulations on predatory pricing, defining it as pricing below average variable cost with the intent to reduce competition.",
            "Interconnection is crucial for seamless communication between subscribers of different networks. TRAI has been instrumental in framing regulations to ensure fair and non-discriminatory interconnection agreements between service providers.",
            "The Telecommunication Interconnection (Reference Interconnect Offer) Regulation, 2002, mandates:",
            "“Every service provider shall, within thirty days of the date of coming into force of this regulation or before starting to offer its service, whichever is later, submit to the Authority, for its scrutiny, a Reference Interconnect Offer containing the technical and commercial conditions for interconnection.”",
            "This regulation has been pivotal in resolving interconnection disputes between operators, ensuring a level playing field for all players in the market.",
            "TRAI has set stringent quality of service parameters for telecom operators to ensure that consumers receive satisfactory services. The Quality of Service of Basic Telephone Service (Wireline) and Cellular Mobile Telephone Service Regulations, 2009, lay down specific benchmarks for various service quality indicators.",
            "For instance, the regulation states:",
            "“The percentage of faults repaired by next working day shall be greater than 90%.”",
            "Such specific benchmarks have compelled telecom operators to maintain high service standards, benefiting millions of consumers across the country.",
            "While the allocation of spectrum is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT), TRAI plays a crucial advisory role in this process. The regulator provides recommendations on various aspects of spectrum management, including pricing, allocation methodology, and efficient utilization.",
            "In its recommendations on “Auction of Spectrum” dated 3rd October 2016, TRAI advised:",
            "“The reserve price for 700 MHz band should be fixed at 43% of its valuation. Reserve price for other bands should be fixed at 80% of the valuation.”",
            "These recommendations have significantly influenced the government’s spectrum allocation policies, ensuring optimal utilization of this scarce resource.",
            "Despite its colonial origins, this Act continues to be the primary legislation governing the telecom sector in India.

            "This provision has compelled telecom operators to implement robust data protection measures, especially given the vast amount of personal data they handle.",
            "This Act, while not specific to the telecom sector, has played a crucial role in maintaining fair competition in the market. It empowers the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to investigate anti-competitive practices and abuse of dominant position.",

            "“No enterprise or group shall abuse its dominant position.”",

            "This case challenged TRAI’s regulations on predatory pricing and significant market power. The Delhi High Court, while largely upholding TRAI’s regulations, struck down a provision that excluded incumbent operators from the ambit of “significant market power” for a period of two years.",
            "The court observed:",
            "“The impugned clause in the predatory pricing regulation which provides that a service provider will not be considered as SMP if its subscribers are not more than 30% of the total subscriber base is arbitrary and illegal.”",

            "This landmark judgment paved the way for smoother entry of new players into the market, ensuring fair interconnection practices.",
            "Despite the robust regulatory framework, the Indian telecom sector faces several challenges. The high debt burden of operators, coupled with intense price competition, has led to consolidation in the market. The advent of 5G technology presents both opportunities and regulatory challenges, particularly in areas of spectrum allocation and infrastructure sharing.",
            "TRAI continues to evolve its regulatory approach to address these challenges. In its recent recommendations on “Regulatory Framework for Over-The-Top (OTT) Communication Services” dated 14th September 2020, TRAI advised:",
            "“It is not an opportune moment to recommend a comprehensive regulatory framework for various aspects of services referred to as OTT services, beyond the extant laws and regulations prescribed presently.”",

            "The Telecom Industry in India has come a long way since the establishment of TRAI in 1997. The regulatory body, armed with a comprehensive mandate and supported by robust legislation, has played a pivotal role in shaping the sector. Through tariff regulations, interconnection norms, quality of service standards, and spectrum management recommendations, TRAI has fostered a competitive and consumer-friendly telecom market.",
            "Landmark laws like the Indian Telegraph Act, the Information Technology Act, and the Competition Act have provided the legal backbone for telecom regulation. Meanwhile, significant court judgments have further clarified and strengthened the regulatory framework.",
            "As India stands on the cusp of the 5G revolution, the role of TRAI becomes even more critical. The regulator will need to navigate complex issues around spectrum allocation, infrastructure sharing, and the convergence of telecom with other sectors like broadcasting and information technology.",
            "The journey of telecom regulation in India is a testament to the country’s ability to adapt its regulatory framework to technological advancements and market dynamics. As the sector continues to evolve, the principles of fair competition, consumer protection, and technological innovation are likely to remain at the core of India’s telecom regulatory philosophy.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "The Competition law is a law that promotes or seeks to maintain market \ncompetition by regulating anti-competitive conduct by various enterprises and \ncompanies. In India, Competition Act 2002 was implemented to prevent practices \nfrom having an adverse effect on competition and to promote and sustain \ncompetition in the markets.The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices act,1969 is currently not in \nforce as it was repealed and replaced by The Competition Act,2002 and The MRTP \nCommission was replaced by the Competition Commission of India.Abuse of DominanceAbuse of Dominance refers to a situation where affirm or group of firms that \nhave a dominant role in the market intend to eliminate a competitor or a \ncompeting firm or dissuade a new firm from entering the market. The dominant \nenterprise or group exercise certain practices that Section 4 of the Competition \nAct prohibits. Some of them are Imposition on predatory prices, denying market \naccess, limiting the supply of goods and services, use of dominant position in \none market to enter into another market.CartelizationCartelincludes an association of producers, sellers, distributors, traders, \nor service providers who, by agreement amongst themselves, limit, control, or \nattempt to control the production, distribution, sale or price of, or, trade in \ngoods or provision of services.",
            "Cartels are agreements between enterprises (including a person, a government \ndepartment, and association of persons/enterprises) not to compete on price, \nproduct (including goods and services), or customers. The Act gives a detailed \ndefinition of an enterprise in section 2 (h). The objective of a cartel is to \nraise prices above competitive levels, resulting in injury to consumers and the \neconomy. For the consumers, cartelization results in higher prices, poor \nquality, and less or no choice for goods or/and services.Telecom SectorThe telecom sector in India has witnessed the intense change over the last \ndecade. The Arrival of Reliance Jio in the telecom market in 2016 and the \nVodafone-Idea merger in 2018 reinforce the steep competition in this sector. In \nthis context, I shall refer to two judicial decisions delivered in recent years \nwhere the telecom market players have initiated complaints against each other \nfor predatory pricing and cartelization.Bharti Airtel V. Reliance JioIn this case, a complaint was filed by Bharti Airtel against Reliance Jio. \nBharti Airtel alleges three basic contentions as follows:",
            "The services granted by Reliance Jio right after its entry into the telecom \nmarket included a â€˜Jio Welcome Offer' under which data, voice, video, and a full \nbouquet of applications were granted free of cost to the purchasers which \nattracted the consumers and gave an impact on their mind to switch to Reliance Jio and to not use any other network as it was pocket friendly to the consumer.The Competition Commission of India started the proceeding with a preliminary \nconference with both the parties and then further went on to examine each \nallegation to the facts as provided by Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio. The \nCompetition Commission has limitedly interpreted the term â€˜relevant market' in \nthe context of the present matter. The Commission has sufficed the wireless \ntelecom services to be the relevant geographical market and focused on the \ndominance of Reliance Jio in its individuality.The Competition Commission of India went on to note that, according to market \ndata, Reliance Jio does not have a market share of more than 7% in each of the \n22 telecom circles in India, and the market consists of several players (such as \nVodafone, Idea, Tata, MTNL, etc.) who have similar financial and technical \ncapabilities. There existed sufficient choice in the market and the consumers \nwere not in any way dependent on a single service provider. In light of this, \nthe CCI held that Reliance Jio cannot be said in the dominant position in the \nrelevant market. As it was not in the dominant position, there does not arise \nany case of abuse of the dominant position through predatory pricing in the \nrelevant market.Competition Commission of India V. Bharti AirtelIn this case, a complaint was filed by Reliance Jio under Section 19(1) of the \nCompetition Act,2002 against Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea, contending that \nthese three telecom operators had formed a cartel and were indulging in \nanti-competitive practices. Further, Reliance Jio filed an application before \nthe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) to monitor the conduct of IDOs \nand COAI.CCI's order (directing investigation under Section 26(1) of the Act) on the \nabove application was challenged before the Bombay High Court which held that \nthe CCI had no jurisdiction in the matters of telecom sector as in the instant \ncase, the matter was also referred to TRAI which is technically well equipped to \ndeal with the said issue. Aggrieved by the impugned order of the High Court, CCI \nand Reliance Jio challenged it before the Supreme Court by way of a special \nleave petition.The Apex Court dismissed the appeals filed by the CCI & Reliance Jio and upheld \nthe decision of the Bombay High Court has deftly resolved the long-debated \nscuffle for predominance between the overarching fair market watchdog, the CCI, \nand the sector-specific regulators, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India by \ndeferring scrutiny into any possible coordination or collusion between the \nexisting telecom players through the platform of COAI or otherwise by CCI.Further, the Court whilst upholding its previous judgment in the SAIL case on \nthe nature of the CCI prima facie order under Section 26(1) of the Act, for the \nfirst time, made a demarcation between examination of competition issues by the \nCCI in a sector having a statutory regulator and a sector without one. The Court \nadduced the need for use of Section 21A of the Act, which makes it obligatory \nfor the CCI to procure the opinion of the sector regulator on sector-specific \nissues first. This way, the Court eventually showed a middle way to sort out the \nlong-debated jurisdictional conflict issue between the CCI and sector \nregulators. By invoking the doctrine of harmonious construction, the court has \nmaintained an equilibrium by giving TRAI the authority to determine the rights \nand obligations of the parties first, and then if it apprehends the existence of \nanti-competitive act, evokes the jurisdiction of CCI.ConclusionAs competition in the Indian telecom sector continues to rise steeply, the \nmarket players are bound to raise similar disputes against each other in the \nfuture. Also, as the Competition Act, 2002 is a penal statute that allows \nimposition of significant penalties, raising a complaint about a violation of \nthis statute turns out as an attractive option for the rival market players.The absence of clear dividing lines between promoting competition and checking \nanti-competitive practices leads to conflicts as we have seen in the above \ncases. The legislatures while enacting the framework under the Competition Act, \n2002 and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act, 1997 failed to establish the \npower and role of competition commission and sectoral regulatory. Both these \nbodies have to formulate boundaries for themselves and ensure that they manage \nto create a pro-consumer business-friendly model for the telecom sector.References:",

            "India has a complex and often challenging regulatory environment. New regulations and industry promotion schemes are announced frequently at the national level. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act which became law in August 2023, aims to protect the privacy of Indian citizens and safeguard personal data in the context of a globally interconnected digital economy. It sets obligations for entities that process data with an emphasis on individuals providing consent for data use and provides safeguards for children’s data. The Act allows for cross-border data transfers and adopts a more permissive approach than previous iterations, granting the government power to note specific countries where data transfers will not be permitted. The Act clarifies that if any other existing Indian law provides for a higher degree of regulation on personal data transfers outside India, then existing law will continue to apply. This will give priority to existing sectoral laws that limit cross border data transfers such as the Reserve Bank of India’s data localization mandate. The Act defines the responsibilities and domain of the new upcoming regulatory body, namely the Data Protection Board, which will set financial penalties for data misuse and would create a grievance management system and outline exemptions to following the Act’s requirements.",

            "In a federal structure, India's determination to much-needed fiscal reforms has been widely applauded at its face value when she relinquished her previous complex and inefficient tax regime to embrace the long-awaited Goods and Services Tax (GST). It has been a significant economic move post-independence and requires validation of facts after its introduction. The present study aims to present a general macroeconomic analysis of the extent to which the adoption of GST has improved existing tax administration and resultant general economic well-being of a democratic political economy like India in light of innovation implementation theoretical perspective. Further, the study tried to determine how the stakeholders perceived such big-bang reform even after the three years of its adoption. The study attempted to assess to what extent the adoption of GST has indeed influenced the economy in general and citizens and/or consumers in particular while using a case-based qualitative inquiry. The present research applied the situation–actor–process; learning–action–performance analysis framework for the case analysis. The facts reveal that India has observed a tremendous increase in tax base vis-à-vis revenue collection. Yet, some efforts are desired to improve the low tax to GDP ratio, skewed GST payers base, negative stakeholders’ perception of GST (revealed through Twitter sentiment analysis), and the evil of tax evasion. The other merits realized by the economy are presented as benefits to the consumers, MSMEs, improved ease of doing business ranking, and foster make-in-India andAatmanirbharBharatmove by the government.",

            "The economic reforms in India after the 1990s pushed her growth as a globally integrated nation with remarkable improvements in terms of regulatory efficacy, macroeconomic stability, and geopolitical constancy (World Bank,2019). Besides China in the Asian continent, India emerged as one of the fastest-growing economies in the last few decades (Paul & Mas,2016). Fortifying the topsy-turvy yet relatively sustained growth story, India has witnessed phenomenal indirect tax reform (Chikermane,2018) in the past three decades and demonstrated economic resilience by embarking upon another breakthrough in July 2017. According to the experts, after liberalizing the Indian economy in 1991, the Goods and Services Tax (henceforth GST) is a significant taxation turnaround by the Indian government (Jha,2019; Siddiqui,2018). India has traversed a long path to embrace GST as an excellent and long-awaited indirect tax reform aimed at one nation, one tax, and one market (GST Council,2020a). The global experience revealed that GST has made the business processes more efficient than ever by simplifying the tax structure and reducing the number of state and central levies (Nutman et al.,2021). GST is an indirect and destination-based tax. It appears to have influenced the consumers indirectly and directly impacted the businesses (Fernando & Chukai,2018); however, its ripple effect is being felt across the three core sectors of the economy (Jha,2019).",
            "The complexities and inefficiencies of previous tax regimes in India (Roychowdhury,2012) compelled the authorities to convert the decade-long discussion into reality. The shortcomings were primarily characterized by cascading turnover taxes between the center and states in the federal structure, making the regime less comprehensive (Rao & Chakraborty,2010). The central and state levies had some inherent limitations, such as central taxes could not cover the value addition in goods outside the manufacturing stage, including a few listed services (Deloitte,2020; Roychowdhury,2012). To transform the indirect taxation system, GOI had introduced the long-awaited Goods and Services Tax or GST in July 2017. Sensing its magnificence, FICCI (2021) called it a big bang economic reform after independence. Despite all merits and demerits of the Indian GST implementation, little understanding exists of its influence on the economy (Kir,2021) in general from the perspective of the stakeholders. Also, a little understanding was observed in the existing body of knowledge, particularly on innovation implementation in the emerging Indian public policy domain even though GST roll-out to be a process innovation in the economic system. It calls for research in the identified field about how fruitful was the introduction and implementation of GST in the economy and the response patterns of the stakeholders.",
            "The present study aims to analyze the extent to which the implementation of GST has improved exiting indirect tax administration and the general economic state of a democratic political economy like India. The way stakeholders have perceived such big-bang economic reform after three years. A theoretical perspective of innovation implementation was applied, citing the context and knowledge gaps concerning a public policy measure in a developing economy. Thus, it attempts to answer two diverse research questions (RQs):",
            "RQ1. How has the implementation of GST affected India's general economic scenario? and",
            "RQ2. How have various stakeholders perceived the new tax regime?",
            "The nature of the research questions asked determines the epistemological ground for the research (Saunders et al.,2019). The core aspect of questions mentioned above predominantly belongs to the interpretive paradigm, which requires selecting appropriate methods justifying constructivist ontology (Saunders et al.,2019). The SAP–LAP analysis-backed qualitative case-based inquiry meets the methodological and contextual requirements.",
            "The study is organized in various sections and sub-sections comprising a literature review about GST, innovation implementation, and SAP–LAP analysis followed by research methods comprising how SAP–LAP analysis is performed with its framework to answer the above research questions. The result and discussion section elaborates the detailed analysis and interpretation of individual components of the SAP–LAP framework concerning GST implementation.",
            "This section presents a literature review about GST and indirect taxes, innovation implementation, and SAP–LAP analysis under three sub-sections followed by motivation for this research and gap analysis.",
            "In public finance, taxes are usually collected as significant revenue sources as direct and indirect taxes. The taxes paid directly by the public, such as corporate income tax, income tax, wealth tax, are referred to as direct taxes. In contrast, indirect tax is essentially consumption-based tax such as value-added tax or VAT, service tax, and customs. The revenues from indirect taxes are shared jointly by the central and state government and some local bodies in the federal structure. In contrast, direct taxes are the central government's subject matter. France implemented GST in 1954, and the same was followed by over 100 countries, including several emerging economies such as Brazil, China, and now India (Kir,2021), after observing its demonstrated success across the globe. Economists noted that a country's development hinges upon the mobilization of tax revenue (Dabla-Norris et al.,2017; Schlotterbeck,2017). It is pertinent to ensure stable tax revenues to meet the significant budgetary heads such as healthcare, infrastructure, and education. The increasing tax revenue leads to economic growth and development (Besley and Persson,2009; Gaspar et al.,2016; Milios,2021). Also, enhancing tax collection is crucial (Akitoby et al.,2018; Fenochietto & Pessino,2013) to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) propounded by United Nations. Therefore, an economy is expected to have an efficient tax policy and administration. However, the tax structure differs across the continents and countries (Besley & Persson,2009; Fenochietto & Pessino,2013). Sindzingre (2007) pinpointed that Asian developmental states do not rely on high levels of taxation, which is characterized by their capacity to commit and intervene credibly in policies directed toward growth rather than a tax.",
            "Research by Onaolapo et al. (2013) revealed that the adoption of value-added tax showed a statistically significant influence on revenue generation in the Nigerian context. The study also pinpointed the need for dedicated and integrated efforts from the stakeholders to improve VAT collections. The study also analyzed how value-added tax impacted revenue generation in Nigeria. They asserted that the consumption-based taxes should be assessed on different considerations such as administrative feasibility, relative revenue potential, voluntary compliance, for better implementation. These considerations also equally apply to GST implementation.",
            "Some of the cross-sectional studies with panel data and case studies were conducted to analyze the impact of socio-political determinants, tax policy, economic dynamics, and economic structure in an economy (Garg,2019; Kir,2021; Kulkarni, & Apsingekar,2021). Plenty of studies unveiled the relationship among factors influencing the revenue outcome while highlighting the complexities in separating the relevant determinants (Crandall & Kidd,2006; Dom,2018,2019). The study conducted by Gupta (2007) explored the relationship between economic development and the structure of the tax revenue realization in developing countries and asserted a positive correlation between per capita GDP and revenue.",
            "Research by Dabla-Norris et al. (2017) evaluated the firm performance changes due to the tax compliance burden in 21 countries using VAT and corporate tax rates to control tax policy. Investigating the effect of tax policy changes on revenues, the study also emphasized on an association between policy reforms and revenue growth in the emerging economies (Akitoby et al.,2018) and maintained that policy reforms can be increased with the rising rate of indirect tax, changing the type of tax being levied, and decreasing level of exemptions. The studies measuring the impact of VAT found mixed results as some observed growth in the revenue (Ebeke et al.,2016; Schlotterbeck,2017) while others found it insignificant (Ngoma & Krsic,2017). Some studies emphasized how socio-political factors determine the extent of revenue collected relative to GDP and asserted that the Gini coefficient was negatively correlated with the revenue collections (Fenochietto & Pessino,2013). Nonetheless, not enough literature could be located in the Indian context expounding implementing a tax administration policy and associated indicators.",
            "The early research analyzing the impact of GST implementation on the Indian economy was limited and utilized only nascent and generic indicators (Bindal & Gupta,2018; Dash,2017; Mishra,2018) to demonstrate whether GST has attained the desired outcome after implementation. The other studies were highly sectoral and regional (Garg,2019; Kulkarni & Apsingekar,2021). In addition, expounding the situation after the implementation of GST, The New Indian Express (2021), in its report on GST, mentioned that the government's bonafide intentions back GST yet, technical glitches and design-related flaws caused ineffective execution during its early phase. The technical malfunction also caused fake invoicing by some business enterprises. Despite all advantages, some significant implementation flaws include technical glitches, frequent changes in the rules, malfunction of input tax credit claim system, multiple tax slabs and frequent changes in items covered under these slabs, etc. (Financial Express,2019; The New Indian Express,2021). Many businesses have to confront multiple litigations due to a lack of clarity on various rules and their varied interpretations in different states. This aroused interest in conducting the study to unearth several theoretical and practical learnings that may lead to future research.",
            "Having cited the above literature, the researchers observed a lack of primary and secondary literature linking indirect tax reform in an economy and its economic impact. The studies cited primarily belong to tertiary literature, which was used to establish the viewpoint. However, due to the nascent stage of GST implementation in India, it becomes difficult to deploy quantitative panel data analysis. Therefore, the study analyzed GST implementation in the economy using a factual SAP–LAP qualitative framework and Twitter sentiment analysis using the stakeholders' perception mapping. It was an exploratory inquiry to advance understanding of a less explored phenomenon with an innovation implementation-led theoretical perspective.",
            "Considering GST as a process innovation in a macroeconomic context, the present research cited relevant studies to analyze the status of GST after three years of implementation. The previous research on innovation implementation revolves primarily around the organizational contexts (Chung et al.,2017; Damanpour & Schneider,2006; Dhir et al.,2020; Malaviya & Wadhwa,2005; Singh et al.,2021a,b), with a slight possibility for being adapted in the context of an economy. An economy akin to an enterprise needs to constantly innovate its key processes to sustain and be competitive in a contemporary environment characterized by ever-changing technology and handling of economic operations (Chung et al.,2017; Krawczyk-Sokolowska et al.,2021). Emerging economies such as India possess numerous possibilities for innovation on several fronts including the micro- and macro-level (Dhir et al.,2020,2021). Past studies have shown that innovation keeps the system competitive and is necessary to propel superior performance (Birkinshaw et al.,2008; Dhir et al.,2021).",
            "Nevertheless, assessing the innovation-specific outcomes is intriguing in a system at both levels. It can be analyzed with its apparent characteristics, such as the effectiveness of implementation and point of innovation itself in terms of benefits derived from it (Klein & Sorra,1996c.f. Chung et al.,2017). It is asserted that approximately two-thirds of the innovations go unsuccessful and pose a financial burden on the system (Altuwaijria & Khorsheed,2012). The entities implementing the invention are bound to fail to attain desired benefits due to failure of innovation or implementation (Chung et al.,2017).",
            "The introduction of GST in India is a process innovation of continuous nature, depending heavily upon the principles of appropriateness, accessibility, and affordability (Fannin,2016). Also, Singh and Dhir (2021) pointed that studies addressing innovation implementation focused on specific organizational contexts, including manufacturing (Dwivedi et al.,2019; Jamwal et al.,2019), Entrepreneurship (Parameswar et al.,2019; Singh et al.,2019), health (Birken et al.,2015; Pradhan et al.,2019), transportation (Shankar et al.,2019), financial inclusion (Malik et al.,2019), and ERP implementation (Nagpal et al.,2019). However, studies cited in the public policy domain were scanty (Singla & Hooda,2018; Sushil,2008; Sushil,2019, Suri & Sushil,2012; Suri & Sushil,2008). The extant literature in this field further revealed that most of the studies on innovation implementation were conducted in the developed economies and, therefore, exhibit the strategies adopted in that context, which cannot be replicated in the emerging economy scenario (Singh et al.,2021a,b). The key differences must be thoroughly analyzed due to contextual variations in terms of demographics, infrastructural, regulatory policies, etc., for ensuring implementation of the innovation (Dhir et al.,2020).",
            "Further, from the theoretical standpoint, the implementation of innovation literature has widely used dynamic capability theory to examine how the organization can adapt its knowledge base in response to environmental changes (Teece et al.,1997; Teece,2018c.f. Singh et al.,2021a,b). The effectiveness of such implementation can be measured using the degree to which the desired outcomes are realized (Singh et al.,2021a,b). According to Piening (2011), the implementation of an innovation, technology, or practice necessitates the creation of new routines for desired outcomes, as was the case of GST, where the government revamped all previous processes (routine). The system continuously tracks the systemic and process-related flaws in GST implementation such as technical glitches, erroneous input-tax credit claim mechanism, multiple tax slabs with frequently changing specified items. (The New Indian Express,2021). The studies primarily adopted dynamic capability theory (Teece et al.,1997), the resource-based view (Chichkanov et al.,2021), grounded theory (Deloitte,2020), etc., to understand the implementation. Yet, studies in public policy-related aspects are limited in numbers (Singla & Hooda,2018), requiring further investigation to analyze the same. Thus, the previous literature revealed some significant research gaps in innovation implementation comprising context gap and knowledge or theory gap. The present research aims at bridging such gaps in the context of GST implementation using an SAP–LAP framework to investigate the degree to which the GST implementation as a process innovation in public policy has impacted the general state of the economy.",
            "The SAP–LAP framework for analysis was initially developed by Sushil (2000) and Sushil (2001a). The present study uses the SAP–LAP framework (Fig.1) to analyze the pre- and post-GST implementation scenario to evaluate the system's efficacy and suggest enhancements. Several scholars in the past applied SAP–LAP analysis tools to study such situations and developed valuable solutions. The selected pioneering and prominent studies are presented in Table1, which exhibits the cross-context and cross-concept use of the technique.",

            "Studies on context-specific use of SAP–LAP framework",
            "The study utilizes a case-based review approach to analyze India's indirect taxation policy framework and associated indicators. The analysis is performed with an interpretive method known as SAP–LAP (situation, actor, process and learning, action, performance) framework developed by Sushil (2000). The SAP–LAP method was widely used by the researchers in case-based studies (Anand et al.,2018; Charan,2012; Chavan et al.,2019; Kanda & Deshmukh,2007; Anand et al.,2018; Naik & Srivastava,2017; Pramod & Banwet,2010; Sushil,2019; Suri & Sushil,2008). As described by Sushil (2009), “SAP–LAP is a generic framework which can be used in various contexts, such as problem-solving, change management, be used as generalized statements for the similar cases in the future by proper synthesis” (p. 11). SAP–LAP application has not been limited to the business verticals only but applied the least in the public policy domain (Chand et al.,2018; Chavan et al.,2019; Suri & Sushil,2008).",
            "The paper focuses on exploring the present state of GST implementation in India by the government on completing its three years. The paper follows SAP–LAP framework-based qualitative design. The study used a step-by-step approach to review extant literature to understand how the past scholars have conceptualized and theorized such a phenomenon. To critically examine the initiatives about indirect taxation and GST mainly, the authors reviewed the publications of the GST Network, Central Board of Indirect Taxes & customs (CBIC), National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog, World Bank, International Monitory Fund (IMF), and relevant policy documents. An attempt was made to pinpoint the gaps and plausible implications on business and society by using the excerpts from literature and discussing with experts and stakeholders affected by GST implementation. Since the emphasis was on assuming the implementation at the last mile beside the experts, the opinions of retailers complying with GST and consumers who are indirectly paying it were considered. The existing framework gaps were recorded through 30 experts, 200 retailers, and 1000 customers. The key criterion for selecting the respondents was their direct and/or indirect involvement in GST-related regulation or compliance.",
            "More so, to add a qualitative dimension to the SAP–LAP-based research and gauge the sentiments of different stakeholders on completion of its three years of GST, the authors have added analyses of tweets, especially as part of the situation analysis and learning synthesis. The study performs the Twitter analysis of the posts containing#GSTand its associated sentiment analysis to identify how the stakeholders, including the business community vis-à-vis the common public on social media platforms, perceived the roll-out and the implementation of GST in India by the government. The researchers performed the data scrapping from Twitter with basic Tweepy (Application Programming Interface or API). The application software used in the process was NVivo (NCapture tool). It enables capturing the tweets using a #hashtag across the timelines. For this research, the restriction kept was the tweets with #GST from India. The present study captured one week's random tweets after completing three years for analysis. The purpose was to see the polarity of the sentiments after three years of GST roll-out in a random data scrapping.",
            "The SAP–LAP framework for analysis was initially developed by Sushil (2000). The expansion of the acronym SAP–LAP refers to a situation that indicates the internal and/or external environment. The external environment may include social, technological, economic, political, and natural environmental factors. In comparison, the internal environment may consist of organization-specific factors such as resources, capabilities, employees, organizational structure, and design. When considering India as an entity for analysis under this framework, the introduction of GST can be taken as a constituent of a situation aspect, and its macroeconomic, socio-political, technological impacts can be considered as the external consequences. Further, keeping the temporal orientation into account, the situation can be referred to as what has happened? what is going on? and what is expected?",
            "The actors in the framework are people, agents, or stakeholders directly or indirectly related to the case situation under consideration. They either influence the condition or are affected by the situation. The stakeholders involved are the government, including the finance ministry, administrators, and policymakers in the GST network, business owners or managers, customers or the general public. It is indeed a highly complex web of actors in one of the largest democracies like India. The third aspect in the framework processes refers to how the situation-specific input transforms into output due to the courses of action initiated by the 'actors.' The actors enjoy the freedom of choice to transform a situation and bring about a change in the situation hand. In this context, the GST collection process, refund or input credit process, audit process, taxpayer complaint resolution process, GST council reform process, etc., are examples of various processes involved. The key actors are expected to strengthen and optimize the strategies to enhance the situation continuously.",
            "The interaction and synthesis of the situation–actor–process framework guide the learning–action–performance framework (Sushil,2000,2019). The first alphabet in the LAP framework stands for learning, which refers to a thorough comprehension of the core issues, problems, and challenges of SAP. It can be referred to as an outcome of the meticulous investigation of the individual components vis-à-vis the collective interplay of SAP. The learning component usually includes the generalizable output for execution or insights on specific situations or objectives. The action is all about converting the learning insights into practice to eradicate the existing systemic deficiencies. It may emphasize enhancing the current processes by improving efficiency and effectiveness.",
            "Moreover, the action component of the framework helps in the development of some actionable policies or guidelines. The action taken will impact the performance, which can be observed through enhanced productivity, efficiency, effectiveness, higher profitability in general and better fiscal discipline, and resultant higher revenue generation in particular. It can be inferred that how flexibility in the system improves the overall performance (Evans & Bahrami,2020; Sushil,2019) and, as a result, how India ranks better in terms of governance, ease of doing business, and systemic transparency by applying the SAP–LAP analysis.",
            "The World Bank statistics (2017–2019) on taxes as a percent of GDP reveals that India needs to increase its share of taxes in GDP at par with most of its developing counterparts. It further reported that the developed countries' ratio is greater than 10 percent compared to India’s 7.8 percent (Table2) and far below the OECD average of 34% (The Economic Times,2020, January). This ratio indicates how well a government can finance its expenditure, reducing the borrowing. The higher proportion shows faster economic development as it enhances the government's ability to finance the expenditure.",

The above data highlighted the rising revenue vis-à-vis is rising cost of collection and a corresponding reduction in the net figures from 2017 to 2018, which can be attributed to the GST implementation. In 2018–2019, the gross tax to GDP ratio was 10.9, indicating a 16 percent fall in tax revenue from the budget estimates. The reduction is due to a shortfall in GST collection (Financial Express,2019). The revenue growth also corresponds to the contribution of GDP figure, which hovers between 6 and 8% for net tax revenue, far below expectations. It indicates the need for further improvement to enhance the tax revenue collections.",

The CGST represents the share of the central government, SGST indicates the state government’s claim, whereas IGST is collected on inter-state movement of goods and/or delivery of services. As shown in Fig.3, the collection of IGST is highest among all across the three years, followed by SGST, CGST and cess. The cess is a minor component charged along with GST in India.",

It will gradually enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the indirect taxation system.",
            "Besides the quantitative studies in the public policy domain, researchers started exploring the qualitative data generated through social media due to its ability to help decision-makers understand the acceptance of the particular policy by different stakeholders (Singh et al.,2020). Also, the policymakers have begun to recognize their social media presence and the responses of users and subscribers (Fig.5). Several scholars such as Das and Kolya (2017), Durán-Vaca, and Ballesteros-Ricaurte (2019), and Das et al. (2020) have attempted to study the influence of the taxation-related aspects using social media analytics. Another study by Shakeel and Karwal (2016) examined the Indian union budget sentiment analysis 2016–2017. Das and Kolya (2017), Singh et al. (2019), and Das et al. (2020) primarily analyzed the Twitter data to understand the sentiment of the general public concerning GST. The startup ecosystem in India was thoroughly investigated by Singh et al. (2020) using Twitter analytics. Such studies revealed the rising trend of research using social network-based qualitative data. To assess the acceptance level of a particular phenomenon, researchers have a wide variety of choices to gather data such as interviews, surveys, and observation.

As reported by experts and taxpayers, some other challenges associated with GST are long time lag in refunds, adaption and development of IT ecosystem, especially by the MSMEs, inability of the system to curb tax evasion, etc. As part of the situation analysis, the above issues and challenges require the concerned actors' action to improve.",
            "In a federal structure, taxes are the subject matter of the union and the states. Therefore, while counting the actors, both are considered and referred to as the ‘government’ in general for the analysis. The other actors in this context are the business executives engaged in the compliance referred to here as ‘business’ and the customers who are paying the taxes indirectly and the society at large. In this tri-partite arrangement, the government is the prime actor while the latter are the complying parties. A systemic change in the name of GST necessitates the active involvement of prime actors in process design that attracts minimal resistance from the affected ones and manages the innovation implementation effectively.",
            "The appropriation of GST is such that both center and state share equally. According to existing arrangements, for instance, if the tax rate is 18%, 9% CGST will go to the central government, whereas 9% SGST will be credited to state government accounts for intra-state transactions. On the other hand, inter-state transactions are dealt with under integrated GST or IGST in which the destination state and the central government share the revenue as mentioned above. Due to the complexity of transactions, especially when multiple states are involved in the trades, sometimes calls for more robust processes to deal with the input credit-related issues. The role of actors from government, both center and state, has become more prominent in resolving such matters. The problems related to revenue sharing and compensation to conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic intensified, for which the authorities are developing a robust mechanism. As a prime-mover, the Goods & Services Tax Council or GST Council-a constitutional body to regulate the various aspects of GST and its nationwide implementation plays a pivotal role. The Union Finance Minister of India chairs the council, and other members include the Union State Minister of Finance or Taxation of all the states. GST council along with the CBIC has played a significant role in the implementation process of GST in India.",
            "The government has taken several interventions and initiatives to improve the implementation process of GST in India. GST is the most extensive indirect tax reform in India's history, which required the integration of a nationwide diverse taxation portfolio into a single taxation system. Goods and Service Tax Network or GSTN was created to enable building a platform to meet various stakeholders' GST-related needs and smoothly facilitate the complex transaction. All the GST processes are covered under the highly diverse responsibilities of GSTN. They range from GST system application design, development and operation to IT infrastructure procurement, ensuring systemic resilience against failure and disaster, helpdesk setup and procedures, training and capacity building, backend system assessment for all the states and union territories, etc. (Fig.6).

Infosys is selected as a Managed Service Provider or MSP for this project. A total of 73 IT/ITeS and fintech companies and one commissioner of commercial taxes (Karnataka) are impaneled as GST Suvidha Providers or GSPs to provide solutions across the nation.

            "Besides process-related general measures expounded earlier, some of the specific issues addressed by the actors (primarily the government) are being highlighted as—a gradual increase in the coverage and the scope of GST in the form of inclusion and exclusion of commodities and services; revision in the coverage of various base rates keeping the consumer sensitivity into account. Likewise, the mechanism for dividing IGST collection between center and state is being negotiated by the central and the state government in the various meetings of the GST council. Accordingly, the center is working out the long-pending due to states (The Economic Times,2020).",
            "Since the government is generating the lion's share of GST revenue (63% approx.) from the public and private sector companies, their significant attention is toward resolving issues they are confronting first. The government is also developing ways to formalize the informal sectors to enhance the tax base (GST Council,2020b) to tame lopsided GST payers. In addition to this, the government needs a mechanism that can facilitate to meaningfully engage the stakeholders on such policy matters, which will create awareness and bust the myths being spread associated with the new fiscal policy instruments such as GST.",

            "For easy and speedy compliance, IT holds a significant role to play. Many companies, especially the MSMEs in the unorganized sector, lack adequate IT infrastructure. It calls for an efficient IT system for user-friendly tax administration. Presently, GSTN is serving as a particular purpose vehicle to facilitate the businesses in this, yet more selective support is desired.",

            "GST subsumed 17 different levies to ease the compliance and remove the cascading effect in taxation. The system needs clarity on several aspects such as precise categorization of goods and services, and tax rates for various goods and services are yet to be fixed. Every next GST council meet comes up with newer agenda for dealing. Moreover, the shift from origin-based to destination-based taxation was not easy to implement in India's largest markets. Now, taxes are being collected based on the consumption of goods and services irrespective of their place of production, which caused a loss of revenue for industrial states. The council resolved that the central government would compensate such a loss of revenue for the initial few years. Also, there has been a demand from several pressure groups to bring high revenue items such as petrol, petroleum products, and alcohol under the ambit of GST, which is still under discussion.",
            "It is challenging for the government to balance inflation and net revenue loss to attain an optimal revenue-neutral rate or RNR. RNR is referred to as a rate at which the government's revenue through the new tax regime (GST in this case) will be equal to the preceding taxation regime. It directly affects the fiscal policy and inflation rate (Kumar et al.,2018). The higher RNR causes a loss of competitive edge for India domestically vis-à-vis globally (Bhattacharya,2017cited from Kumar et al.,2018). The higher cost will push inflation and, in turn, badly affect the purchasing power. Narula (2016) asserted that RNR is one of the most significant GST implementation challenges and maintains that the government should ensure no revenue loss while adopting to a new taxation regime.",
            "The Twitter sentiment analysis revealed that many stakeholders perceived the roll-out of GST negatively. One of the reasons could have been the lack of proper awareness about the new tax regime. Lourdunathan and Xavier (2017) suggested that India, a democratic country, should clarify its citizens about the recent amendments. Due to a lack of awareness, the citizens sometimes pay more taxes than required, especially in the rural areas and subsequent knowledge of which leads them to wear a negative perception of the tax regime.",

In another move, it was decided by the government that GSTN would provide free accounting and billing software to small taxpayers.",
            "The rates of GST were decided considering the nature of commodities. Some of the entities classified as necessities were suitably reviewed and moved from the high tax bracket (18–28%) to the low-tax bracket, which several stakeholders took as a welcome move. In the 36th meeting of the GST Council in July 2019, the rate rationalization moves to emphasize and promote clean energy by council. The council decided to reduce the GST rates on electric vehicles from 12 to 5% and charger/charging stations from 18 to 5%.",
            "A Group of Ministers or GoM was constituted to study the revenue trend and assess the underlying reasons behind structural patterns influencing the revenue collection in some states. It would include looking at plausible reasons behind the deviation of the revenue collection targets from basic assumptions.",
            "The GST council introduced an electronic way or e-way bill system from April 1, 2018, initially for all inter-state movement of goods that now covers intra-state movements. This initiative aimed to allow the movement of goods across the nation, which resulted in hassle-free transportation. The E-way bill was a monumental shift from the departmental policing model to the self-declaration model, reducing high administration costs.",
            "From August 21, 2018, the council decided to have a system barring the generation of the e-way bill if a recipient or supplier does not file a GST return for two consecutive tax periods. It resulted in regularity and timeliness of compliance by the taxpayers.",
            "It was also observed that in many countries, GST implementation resulted in an inflationary trend despite a provision of an input tax credit. The meticulous analysis revealed that it has happened because of the non-passing of the benefits to the consumers by suppliers involved in the profiteering. Ideally, the benefit of increased input tax credit or decrease in tax rate should pass to the recipient. When it does not pass to the recipient, it is treated as illegal profiteering. The central government constituted NAA to examine the non-passing of the benefits of reduced tax incidence or increase in input tax credit under GST.",

In the pre-GST regime, payers have to comply with significant taxes such as value-added tax or VAT, service tax, central sales tax or CST, octroi and 14 more such state and local levies. The comparison explicitly reveals a sharp upswing in GST revenues between 2017 and 2020 compared with the taxes collected between 2014 and 2017. For instance, if the revenue figures for 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 are to be compared, there is a sharp rise of more than 30 percent. Similarly, the collections for 2018–2019 record growth of more than 60% over the previous fiscal (Fig.7).

Likewise, the data indicated for 2020–2021 is also for a single quarter (April–June 2020). The data also demonstrates a sudden decline in revenues through GST in the quarter due to the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown and the resultant extension of the deadlines by the government, which may exhibit a hike in the next quarter.

Barring a few short-term exceptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, India observed an aggregate demand boost. However, the rise in manufacturing activity and employment could not be attained as expected before the GST introduction. It has gainfully improved the country's overall investment climate, and it will subsequently benefit the states.",
            "GST is assumed to be significant indirect tax reform to propel the economic growth engine, promisingly replacing the intriguingly complex and multi-layers taxation regime with a much simpler, transparent, and tech-driven administration. The present study's analysis revealed that the benefits observed due to its implementation would remove the impediments to inter-state trade and thereby project India as a common market and realize the vision of one nation, one tax, and one market. The study indicates that GST implementation is on its way to attaining the set objectives of unification of the Indian market, simplifying the compliance procedure, and enhancing the tax base to finance the developmental aspiration of the nation. The outcomes indicated that the GST being a process innovation has been implemented well hitherto with some temporal adjustments as the effectiveness of implementation hinges on the extent to which the stated objectives are attained, which is consistent with the implementation-related study by Singh et al. (2021a,b). However, it is too early to say that introduction of GST has led to the attainment of these targets yet the preliminary analysis illustrates that it has been a promising move. It is evident through some of the key economic indicators mentioned in the SAP–LAP analysis that within the short span of the GST regime, the government could expand its tax base without hurting the stakeholders' sentiment and attain a much better ranking on the ease of doing business while nurturing MSMEs. Additionally, the processes involved, such as GST collection, refund or input credit, audit process, GST council reforms, GST Network, taxpayers' complaints, require continuous improvement and time bound re-engineering to meet changing business requirements.",
            "The LAP synthesis revealed first the situation-based learning, which demands a robust IT system to tame the evaders and miscreants such as recent fake invoicing fiasco. It has reduced the chances of error and enhanced faceless and timely verification. The frequent changes in the GST provisions, on the one hand, offer flexibility, but at the same time, it causes troublesome transactions for the enterprises. As revealed from the Twitter sentiment analysis results that the stakeholders exhibited a declivity toward the GST implementation, which can be the outcome of lack of awareness and a typical tendency of inherent resistance to change for the new system. The innovation implementation literature also necessitates the constructive engagement of the stakeholders to ensure its success which is consistent with the study by Chung et al. (2017).",
            "The action taken includes the introduction of flexibility and simplicity in the compliance mechanism as and when desired. The e-way bill system also facilitated efficient compliance and partially overcame the issues related to tax evasion. Nonetheless, the GST regime should establish a robust design with solid checks and balances to eradicate the evaders and promote good tax governance ultimately. Furthermore, the capacity-building efforts by the CBIC are yet to show up the outcomes which may be public after the implementation of the ambitious SAKSHAM system. The performance analysis explicitly exhibited the superiority of the GST regime over the past VAT regime on several dimensions. The GST implementation has immensely benefitted the consumers, MSMEs, and new enterprises by removing multiple compliance requirements through process simplification and thereby improving India's ease-of-doing-business ranking. To achieve the ambitious Make-in-India andAatmanirbhar Bharatgoals, GST can prove to be a gamechanger, provided the efforts are directed toward eradicating the systemic loopholes.",
            "The theoretical implications of the study are evident through its propensity to address the knowledge gap encompassing an exploratory case-based inquiry linking GST implementation and economic scenario in the Indian context. It also established that the implementation issues require constant supervision and immediate action. The findings drawn from SAP–LAP analysis are also consistent with the report conceptualized by CAG (2019) presented through Fig.8is self-explanatory, exhibiting the extent to which the objectives of GST roll-out are attained. It mentions that the two significant market objectives, unification and simplification of the tax structure, have been achieved well except with a slight fallout on simplified form and procedure. However, the other objective about IT compliance is partially completed with some fallout. The actors must make a collaborative endeavor (Singh and Dhir,2021) to create a simplified IT-enabled process to attain the last and most important objective (Fig.8). Although such problems are expected during the transition phase of implementation through IT as observed in the previous research by Anand et al. (2018), Suri (2005), Suri and Sushil (2012), and Suri and Sushil (2008), which are commonly related to implementation hurdles due to ineffective change management strategies (Siddiqui,2018; Singh et al.,2020).",

Future studies may advance such a combined perspective to draw more inclusive research outcomes. The study also highlighted the social networking site such as Twitter as a powerful medium to meaningfully connect with the stakeholders in policy implementation at large. Also, the study advanced the understanding of innovation implementation research from enterprise context to the macroeconomic context for an economy which may be taken as an incremental extension of theoretical knowledge on policy execution. Nonetheless, the present study, primarily qualitative, neither delves upon the impact of GST implementation on the macroeconomic and fiscal parameters nor attempted to analyze it on any specific microeconomic indicator. Also, GST implementation in India is still in the introduction phase; therefore, not enough panel data could be generated to establish the relationship between GST tax reform and economic growth using econometric modeling. Future studies can show the relationship between the two indicators using quantitative or econometric modeling to ensure the broader generalizability of the findings. More so, the effectiveness of the GST implementation can be measured by quantitatively comparing the set objectives with several fiscal indicators.",

            "Contemporary digital society has become a critical agent for transformation in various spheres of life and a new methodological framework for interdisciplinary research. It has emerged as a parallel entity alongside conventional society, where an individual's membership is not only limited to the physical world but also extends to the digital realm. In fact, a person's membership in the physical world is incomplete without their connection to the digital society. Digital technology is instrumental in driving social transformations in areas such as the economy, politics, culture, and religion. The striking feature of digital society is digital data production in the form of big data. Unlike in a conventional society, people's every move and behavior in a digital society are calculated and recorded as data. In this global context of a digital society, India has created opportunities for digitalization for its people since 2000, with significant strides made between 2015 and 2016. Reliance Jio, a telecom company, helped to accelerate this process by offering free unlimited Internet packages on a mass scale. This led to a tremendous surge in service industries and the emergence of new sectors, as well as a digital revolution in the conventional systems of the economy, politics, culture, education, religion, and law. However, this transformation has also exposed a significant challenge—the digital divide or digital inequalities, which cannot be overlooked or undermined in sociological research. It would be wrong to reduce digital inequality to a mere technological divide; it is a complex issue shaped by prevailing socioeconomic conditions, digital inequalities, and capability inequality. The study revealed that India's prevailing socioeconomic divide is the source of its wide digital divide. This digital divide exists across both rural and urban areas, affecting access to digital education and economic opportunities. The digital divide is also found between under-resourced urban areas and affluent residential areas. This study's theoretical framework draws on the studies of Castell on the information society and Dijk's concept of the network society.",

            "The growing global socioeconomic divide and the digital divide are currently the most pressing issues that sociology is grappling with. The world is undergoing a digital transformation. As a result, digital society, digital space, digital capital, digital relations, digital access, and so on have become increasingly relevant to sociology, like any other societal aspect and social relations. The digitalized world is described using various terms, such as information society (Dijk,2006) and network society (Dijk,2006; Castells,2010). These terms are used to denote the society that has emerged from the impact of information and communication technology. The most commonly used term is information society. Castells (2010) and Dijk (2006) have used the terms “information society” and “network society” to describe this type of society.",
            "In the 1970s, the information and communication technological paradigm in the United States initiated a technological development that resulted in the digital revolution. This new paradigm shifted European and Western societies' political and economic conditions. The new technological paradigm surpassed the early rise of the electronics industry in the 1940s−1960s, as it fostered a culture of freedom, individual innovation, and entrepreneurialism (Castells,2010, p. 4). An important question to consider is whether technology has developed uniformly on a global scale. Did technology determine different levels of development? Did society determine different levels of technological advancement? The digital divide question makes us consider societal or state intervention in technological advancement and vice versa. Castells (2010, p. 5) believes that technology does not determine society but society does determine the course of technological change because many factors, such as individual inventiveness and entrepreneurialism, are involved in the process of scientific discovery, technological innovation, and social applications. However, the results depend on the complex interaction pattern between technology and society. He further argues that technological determinism is a false problem because technology is society, and society cannot be understood or represented without its technological tools.",
            "Society and technology are inevitably linked, and society determines technology and its advancement. Digital society can be viewed as a parallel to physical society, in which individuals voluntarily become members. However, its membership is as important as the membership of the physical society. Physical society refers to the material existence of social institutions and the physical appearance of social relations. We accept that abstract entities, such as norms, values, and customs, are essential societal elements. In the physical society, human actions and relationships are regulated socially, culturally, and legally, while in the digital society, online behavior is governed by simple legal guidelines. However, these guidelines cannot be equated with social control mechanisms present in physical society.",
            "A question then arises: Does society determine the digital divide? The answer to this question is yes, because the prevailing socioeconomic divide is the root cause of the digital divide in any society. In this context, it can be argued that the digital divide cannot be understood in isolation but rather in relation to the global socioeconomic divide. India has been part of the digital society since the beginning of the 21st century with the introduction of the Internet and information and communication technology. However, it was not until a significant shift occurred in 2016 with the launch of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. by Reliance Communication Ltd. that a true digital revolution took hold. This revolution marked the beginning of a new age of digitalization in India, leading to a subsequent smartphone revolution.",
            "The study is based on qualitative methods such as unstructured interviews, case studies, and participant observation. The present study conducted a review and interpretation of published studies and also included an empirical study. The study selected Guwahati, the capital city of Assam, and Buribail village (District Cachar) in Assam as its locations. The respondents were students, working youths, professionals, and rural dwellers. In the unstructured group interview, 80 interviews were conducted in both villages and cities. Case studies were conducted in under-resourced areas in Guwahati city where the living conditions of some houses and dwellers were analyzed. Additionally, participant observation methods were used among students and youths in urban residential areas, such as apartments. The study, which focused on a city and a village, can serve as a hypothesis for further research on the issue of the digital divide. Moreover, this study mainly focused on interpreting the inevitable link between socioeconomic disparity and the digital divide in India. The theoretical framework of this study highlights the interconnectedness of digital society and physical society, emphasizing that the digital divide cannot be reduced to a mere technological problem but must be understood as a complex techno-social problem.",
            "The results of the study revealed that digital society is a new techno-social phase that has emerged globally, and India has become a part of it. However, India has not been able to address the issue of socioeconomic inequality. India's prevailing socioeconomic divide is the source of a wide digital divide. The digital divide was found to exist primarily in the educational and economic aspects of both rural and urban areas. There is a wide digital divide between rural and urban areas, as well as between affluent cities and under-resourced urban areas. The digital divide mainly includes poor digital infrastructure in villages and under-resourced urban areas, limited access to digital facilities, and poor socioeconomic conditions. However, cities and affluent parts of cities are technologically advanced and have access to digital facilities. A detailed discussion is made in the sections below.",
            "The first question that arises is as follows: Do we differentiate digital society from network society or information society? Our approach was not to consider the digital society as a distinct entity but rather as an extension of the network society or information society. An important issue that has been highlighted is how digital society encompasses societal dimensions and turns into a parallel society. Instead of focusing on defining the digital society as a separate physical entity, it may be more useful to revisit Castell's (2010) concept of the network society. He elaborated on how the emergence of a new technology or technological paradigm, based on the development of information and communication technology, has transformed the world since 1970 and diffused unevenly across various regions of the world. Technology does not determine society; rather, it is a society that determines technology. This indicates that technology is regulated by the values, norms, and needs of people within society, as stated by Castells (2010). Castells (2010) coined the term “network society” and referred to the emerging society as a network society. He preferred this term over information society or knowledge society because microelectronics-based networking technologies brought new capabilities to an old form of social organization in the knowledge society or the information society. He claimed that digital communication networks are the backbone of the network society (Castells,2005, p. 4). The network society is based on communication networks that transcend boundaries, making the network society global. The network society is based on global networks of capital, goods, services, labor, communication, information, science, and technology. Due to their programming, networks are selective, and as a result, while the contemporary network society has diffused throughout the world, it still does not include everyone. Although global networks have an impact on all human beings, they have excluded large sections of the population in the early 21st century (Castells,2005, p. 5). Dijk's (2006) concept of information society and network society signifies the contemporary development of modern society, characterized by widespread information exchange and the use of information and communication technology in every sphere of life. His classification of society as an information and network society also corresponds with concepts such as capitalist society and post-modern society. Information is a fundamental aspect of an information society that permeates all aspects of society. In an information society, the societal organization is based on science, rationality, and reflexivity; the economy (agrarian and industrial) increasingly leads toward information production, and the labor market is based on information processing skills that require knowledge and education. Culture in the information society is determined by media and information products through various symbolic entities and meanings (Dijk,2006, p. 19). The network society is defined as a social structure that relies on social and media networks as its infrastructure, with organizational networks existing at the individual, group, or organizational and societal levels. The network function serves as a means of linking all units, including individuals, groups, and organizations. Individuals are the fundamental unit of a network society in the West, whereas families, communities, and workgroups may be the network units in Eastern societies (Dijk,2006, p. 20). A network is defined as a collection of links between unit elements, where nodes represent the elements and the unit systems. A single link between two elements is called a relation(ship). Networks are a mode of organization for complex systems in nature and society (Dijk,2006, p. 24), with the individual as the basic unit of a network society. Traditional collectivities such as joint families, communities, and tribes have become fragmented. Different kinds of communities have emerged that are connected through larger-scale networks, even though they continue to live in their traditional families, neighborhoods, and organizations. This development has made the work environment more extensive and connected due to the networks (Dijk,2006, pp. 35–36).",
            "Tim Berners-Lee's leading innovation, the World Wide Web, came along in 1989 and played a critical role in the digitalization of the world, which transformed Internet technology from a small network of computers into global communication systems. Until then, the Internet was used only for military and research purposes, but the World Wide Web broadened its network. With this technological transformation, the material foundation for a new society was laid: a digital society (Redshaw,2020). Information flow is the key feature or basis of a digital society. Digital society and the information age have a definite pattern of social relations and communication (fundamental structural elements of society) derived from a complex system of relations in the physical society. On the one hand, the term “physical society” refers to a society where people live in systems of physical contact and have face-to-face relationships. On the other hand, digital society is a virtual system of social relations that allows individuals to gain membership and citizenship through the use of the World Wide Web and the Internet. The establishment and operation of a physical society require physical infrastructure and an environment. Similarly, the establishment and operation of a digital society require digital infrastructure such as computers, mobile phones, the World Wide Web, the Internet, and applications.",
            "The digital society is characterized by a flow of information through global networks at unprecedented speeds. The “superconnected” life through the “Internet of things” is the most striking feature of digital society, where big data and data mining play a crucial role (Redshaw,2020). The digital society became a global transformation due to the fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0. This techno-social transformation is closely linked with consumerism, and it aligns with the current advanced industrial age for greater market benefits and industrial benefits. Late capitalism or advanced capitalism extensively regulates society, political economy, and everyday life to the extent that all human activities are digitalized and become objects of profit for industries. The digitalization of life has undoubtedly upgraded the standard of living, but, at the same time, it has raised many questions regarding digital use and consumption, digital trends or commercial trends, power games, and so on. The consumption trend, particularly in popular culture and social media in India, has been growing fast, raising questions about digital space, the capitalization of digital space, digital activism, and the digital divide. The culture industry or popular culture (Horkheimer and Adorno,1944; Marcuse,1964) is legitimately utilized or rationalized with the notion of “entertainment” in an advanced industrial society. In contemporary society, social media is not just a medium of communication but rather an industry that generates its audience and produces content. Social media has recently become a new reality and a digital phenomenon. Industry 4.0 marked the beginning of a new digital society where people's access to technological infrastructure and the Internet is inevitable. Industry 4.0 refers to a digital, data-driven, interconnected industry that transforms production, marketing, labor, healthcare, and human relations, among others (Banholzer,2022). Those who cannot access technological infrastructure and the Internet are cut off from mainstream society and the global village. From the point of access and capability of people, digital inequality and the digital divide appear as major global phenomena. The European Commission (2021) planned a highly innovative and ambitious industrial strategy for Europe. The main focus was on creating an economic transformation in Europe to augment the change. Industry 4.0 was coined in Germany in 2011 as a future project of the country and an integral element of its high-tech industrial strategy. It mainly focused on the stability of employees in production systems and ecological dimensions in the form of “green production” for a carbon-neutral and energy-efficient industry (European Commission,2021, p. 8). The network society is instrumental in developing the digital society. The evolution from a network society to a digital society is referenced in Dijk's (2006) analysis of the development of information and communication technology. The most striking foundation of a network society is microelectronic technology, which enables telecommunications, data communications, and mass communications to be carried out. This technology is the basis for the improvement of communication capacities in the new media, including speed, storage capacity, accuracy, stimulus richness, and complexity of operations. The second fundamental structure of network society is the use of a uniform language in microelectronics for exchanging signals. This uniformity is the language of digital signals. Digitalization is the binding structure for all new telecommunication, data, and mass media networks (Dijk,2006, p. 43). Digitalization refers to the process of converting analog signals, such as sounds and images, into digital signals made up of ones and zeroes (bits). This allows for the fast and uninterrupted transmission and connection of these signals with the help of microelectronics. Digital signals can be easily processed and manipulated to improve the quality of data, texts, sounds, and images (Dijk,2006, p. 44).",
            "The digitalization of the network society is a new technological development in the world's communication system. Questions that arise are as follows: Is it only about communication or more than this? To take a critical theory, or the Frankfurt School's stance of “techno-rationality” and “democratic unfreedom,” we can claim that, although the technology of communication and networking is created by the subjective state of human beings, it has been determined by the objective social structural mechanisms of society. Objective social structural elements may be industry, statism, economic policy, the political power system, and so on. Therefore, communication in a network society or information society is not simply a mechanism of human relations and exchanges but rather a source of a new mode of control. Techno-rationality legitimizes democratic freedom by creating the mechanisms (digital nods) of a lack of freedom in an industrial system. Humans use digital technology that is already programmed in such a way that its result will meet the desired goal of the industry.",
            "The digital society and physical society cannot function separately because elements such as social relationships, societal structure, social institutions, norms, values, culture, and social control are redefined as complex techno-social systems in the new digital world. This technocratic social structure of the digital society has significantly altered the traditional activities of the physical society. The digital society represents a blend of techno-social and economic progress. This advancement is what neo-Marxists like Adorno and Horkheimer (1944), Marcuse (1964), and Ralf (1957) called an advanced industrial society. Membership in a digital society is not mandatory, and individuals having the option to choose is just as crucial as being a member of a physical society. However, its membership is as important as the membership of the physical society. This is because the vast influence and widespread integration of digital technologies into human life make it impossible for any individual worldwide to remain isolated from the digital society. In short, the term “physical society” refers to the tangible presence of social institutions and the observable connections within social relationships. However, it is important to recognize that abstract entities such as norms, values, customs, and so on are also inevitable elements of society that have no physical existence but appear in the social activities of human beings.",
            "Just as the globalization of technology and digital society reshaped the world, the digital divide added a new dimension to the persisting global socioeconomic divide. Addressing the digital divide has become a global concern due to the significant role that technological progress and techno-consumption play in the global political economy (Figure 1).",

The gap exists between individuals who have access to IT as an integral part of their lives and those who do not. Access to technology also varies across geographical areas. For instance, rural areas have poor access to the Internet (Riggins and Dewan,2005, p. 300).",

The digital divide is also visibly prevalent in the local economy.",
            "The digital divide in India cannot be analyzed as a single issue. Considering that pre-existing socioeconomic divides is also important, India is characterized by various socioeconomic divides, such as caste stratification, the rural-urban divide, capability inequality, and class disparity. Dalits are considered to be the lowest stratum of caste groups in India, whose social and economic position is much worse than that of any other population in India. India's rural areas are still highly under-resourced and poorly managed compared to its urban areas, which are much more developed and technologically advanced (Figure 2).",

            "Economic:The economic situations of individuals and social groups are based on their occupations. In any society, people maintain two kinds of economic bases: job/work and skills. India has a serious issue with work opportunities due to a lack of skills or poor technical skills. In contemporary society, static skills are no longer relevant; individuals need to continuously upskill themselves to survive in the competitive market. Unfortunately, the low attainment of education is a problem, resulting in a limited number of technically skilled laborers. Therefore, digitalization may not be able to bring about significant changes in the working conditions and overall economy of manual workers (India Skills Report,2021).",
            "India's employment trend is largely informal, with a large percentage of the workforce engaged in informal jobs. This informal workforce in India encompasses individuals working in private enterprises, daily wage laborers, domestic helpers, and manual laborers in the formal sector who work without any socioeconomic security or benefits. The total population employed in India is 461.52 million, of which 415.23 million have informal jobs. Of the total number of people employed, 90% of men and 92% of women are informally employed. The education of workers in the informal sector is low. Educational attainment is also low among domestic laborers, street vendors, sweepers, and manual construction workers. Of these workers, over 60% of women and 35% of men had dropped out of primary school (World Bank Report).",

            "In 2007, Reliance Jio sparked a revolution in India by providing unlimited 3G and 4G Internet access at an affordable price. This Indian telecommunications company, also known as Jio, launched its commercial 4G services in 2016 with free data and voice services, a strategy that was later adopted by other telecom companies such as Airtel, BSNL, and more. Moreover, the partner policy of mobile phone companies that began offering 4G smartphones at much lower prices also played a significant role in contributing to the growth of Jio, Airtel, BSNL, etc. The availability of smartphones from Chinese mobile companies in the Indian market changed the entire consumption pattern. Compared to Nokia and Samsung, Chinese companies (Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, Karbonn, etc.) offered smartphones at a significantly lower price, which was easily affordable for most people in India. Later, Nokia and Samsung also followed the same policy to create a greater customer network. These Chinese smartphone companies ensured the purchasing capacity of mobile phones for workers such as rickshaw pullers, daily wage laborers, and factory workers. Thus, Reliance Jio's data plans and a new policy among smartphone companies, particularly Chinese companies, contributed to the advancement of consumer networks that eventually helped popular culture and social networking to grow exponentially. The social network transformed after the advent of Web 2.0 in the early 21st century, evolving into comprehensive platforms for data collection, analysis, and content creation. The integration of social networks with popular culture has been instrumental in the massive growth of the digital population, ultimately positioning India as a leading consumer trendsetter in the world.",
            "Upon examining the widespread use of social media, it becomes apparent that it functions as both a component of the culture industry and a commercial media industry. O'Reilly and Battelle (2009) concept of Web 2.0 has shed light on the evolution from “network as service” to “network as platform.” “Network as platform” refers to harnessing the power of networks to create applications, which is key to attracting and engaging users. The industry encompasses huge organizations that facilitate software provision and a community of users connected by social networking platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, etc. Mandiberg's (2012) concepts of “amateur media” and “user-generated content” showed us how social media had enabled user participation in media in two ways: as both producers and consumers. Media consumption has changed from a unidirectional to a multidirectional system. Mandiberg (2012) noted the massive growth of social media use because of the affordability of computers, software, and the Internet in the early 21st century. Data scientists have claimed that “media analytics” (Manovich,2018) is the basis for the consistent growth of the culture industry. Social media has changed the prevailing media system from a unidirectional media-audience relationship to a multidirectional communication process. People are presently not merely passive audiences but active participants; technological advancement has enabled the majority of people to use social media to produce and distribute content. Until the end of the 20th century, media was a professional organization, and people were simply audience members. However, this relationship has become less distinct because of the multidirectional broadcasting started by new media forms such as blogs and social networking sites, which focus on active audience participation instead of unidirectional broadcasting. This happened mainly because of the affordability of computers, software, and the Internet; the majority of people were able to purchase these for personal use (Mandiberg,2012, p. 1). Significant technological innovations in social media have led to the development of participatory systems such as messaging applications, like and dislike buttons, sharing options for various types of content (photos, videos, blogs, and other contents), and comment features. Mandiberg called these types of social media content “user-generated content” (Mandiberg,2012, p. 2). It is interesting to note that technological intelligence creates a huge community of users of applications and produces user-generated data in real time, which is useful for social networks, culture industries, and business platforms such as Amazon, Google, and so on. Seeing the massive change in network applications (software), Tim O'Reilly (2012) conceptualized Web 2.0 to describe the network as a platform for user-generated and industrial use of real-time user-generated data. Web 2.0 harnesses collective intelligence and can be considered a mature stage of the web (formally known as the World Wide Web) (O'Reilly and Battelle,2009). Network applications are systems for harnessing collective intelligence that depends on managing, understanding, and responding to massive amounts of user-generated data in real time, which include data subsystems such as location and identity (of people, products, and places). The smartphone revolution further widened the web as it moved from desktops to people's pockets. The most remarkable addition to Web 2.0 is the use of sensors in web searches instead of manual human searches; motion and location sensors extensively record human activity and store it as data. In this day and age, people's every activity, including their choices of food, clothing, and places; their engagement with popular culture items; their time spent using social media; the nature of the content they follow; and their current locations or previously visited locations, are recorded as data (big data) in the era of advanced Web 2.0. The culture industry, social media, and other service industries collect, present, and use this data in real time (O'Reilly and Battelle,2009, p. 1).",
            "Real-time media analytics represents a major technological breakthrough in service industries. Companies sell cultural goods and services through websites and apps (such as Amazon, Apple, Spotify, and Netflix) that organize searchable information for their users. This is made possible through platforms such as Google, Baidu, and Yandex. To increase sales and attract more consumers, these companies utilize social communication and information-sharing tools such as Facebook, QQ, WeChat, WhatsApp, and Twitter. Additionally, they use media-sharing platforms such as Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, and iQiyi. These companies rely on the computational analysis of massive media data sets and data streams. The practice of analyzing large amounts of content and interaction data across the culture industry began in 1995 and matured in 2010 when Facebook reached 500 million users. These data include information on users' online behavior, physical activity, media content created by companies, and media content created by users of social networks. People's online behavior is monitored through browsing pages, link tracking, post sharing, post linking, content viewing, content playing or reading, and ad clicking. Physical activity data pertain to social network and online platform usage, including the time and location of use. Media content created by companies are, for example, songs, movies, videos, and books; and media content created by users of social networks includes posts, conversations, images, and videos (Manovich,2018). Companies have used two kinds of data: “data sets” (static or historical data) and “data streams” (data in real-time). However, currently, industries are increasingly using real-time data analysis. Sociology, digital humanities, and computational social sciences analyze data sets or historical data.",
            "When widespread poverty, hunger, unemployment, and poor living conditions are prevalent, the apparent poor status of social wellbeing in India becomes the topic of discussion. As such, the consumption of popular culture and social media in India may not be entirely justifiable, as leisure and entertainment are often reserved for industrial workers or employees in the United States and other advanced industrial societies (started by Fordism), who have the means and material wellbeing to consume popular culture for relaxation. Therefore, the consumption of popular culture and the notions of “entertainment” and “free time” are linked (Horkheimer and Adorno,2002), which is the basis of labor management for mass production (Fordism) in an advanced industrial society. In India, a large number of people are unemployed and struggle to maintain a basic standard of living and access to education and healthcare.",
            "The Oxfam International (2021) revealed that the top 10% of the Indian population holds 77% of the total national wealth, indicating a vast class gap and extreme inequality. Therefore, mere consumption growth does not necessarily validate progress in a nation like India. Despite these challenges, India had a digital population of 468 million in 2020, which has been continuously growing due to the country's large population. The culture industry has benefited from this growth, as popular culture production and consumption are widespread. The entertainment business in India has thus been growing rapidly, albeit against a backdrop of inequality and socioeconomic challenges. According to the FICCI and EY (2020,2021) report on Media and Entertainment in India, Indians spent 4.5 h a day on their phones in 2020, a significant increase from 3.5 h in 2019 and a 25% increase from 2017. With 4.5 h per day, India held the 3rd position in the world for the most time spent on phones in 2020, surpassing China, Mexico, Argentina, and South Korea. Additionally, consumers in India spent 1,669 billion minutes online in 2020, a 32% increase compared to 1,261 billion minutes in 2019.",
            "The digital inclusion policy aims to expand the reach of the digital network to cover more areas. Given that the rural population constitutes nearly 70% of India's total population, including rural areas in the digital network would benefit the telecom and service industries. However, there is currently a lack of initiatives to enable rural people to adopt digital facilities. What can we teach a rural person with low literacy skills about technology? Will he/she be able to use Google or any app? In the survey, it was found that rural areas have inadequate digital infrastructure, limited access to the digital world, and insufficient capability to make use of digital facilities. Although Internet connections are available in villages and smartphones are available to almost everyone, they are mostly used for making phone calls and consuming entertainment content.",
            "A total of 50 urban respondents and 30 rural respondents participated in the study. Of the 50 urban respondents, 30 were from under-resourced urban areas. A set of questions related to education and the economy were used in the study, with a focus on unstructured group interviews and observation to obtain a better understanding of the issue. The data were presented in a qualitative form, as the study did not use statistical analysis. The digital divide between rural and urban areas was found to exist mainly in two aspects: education and digital economy.",
            "Education:Rural youths were found to be fascinated by the world of new media and popular culture. However, their usage patterns were more for entertainment than for productive, learning-oriented, or skill-oriented purposes. The schools in the surveyed village were found to be functioning with minimum facilities and without any digital infrastructure. The teachers were not well-versed in technology related to teaching and learning. The absence of colleges and vocational and training institutions in villages is another major issue that hinders the participation of villages in global digitalization. In contrast, urban schools and colleges have better access to digital technology, and teachers are well acquainted with the use of technology. An interesting fact is that urban children use facilities such as e-learning and other digital learning platforms such as BYJU's, Unacademy, WhiteHat Jr., and so on, while rural children are unable to access such facilities mainly due to a lack of proficiency in using technology, poor digital infrastructure, and a lack of resources.",
            "Digital economy:The poor condition of digital agriculture and the lack of access of rural dwellers to digital agriculture are the main causes of the divide between rural and urban areas. The economy in urban areas is relatively more developed at the micro level. In contemporary society, small businesses are regulated on digital platforms, and digitalized service industries have transformed people's economic situations. Almost the entire rural economy in India is dependent on agriculture; therefore, its digitalization is inevitable, but it has been found that villagers are still unaware of digital agriculture. There is no evidence of digitalized agriculture, so rural dwellers' access to it is still a distant dream. Villagers hardly keep track of the market price of their products; they sell them to middlemen or traders in the local market at very low prices. Villagers have no knowledge of local branding of their products, marketing on digital platforms, or online business; they conduct payment through Google Pay/Phone Pay. The irony of the situation is that rural dwellers sell their agricultural products to traders who take them to nearby towns and cities. The same products are purchased by villagers working in towns at a price much higher than the price his/her fellow village dwellers levied.",
            "Social stratification and the digital divide in the urban areas of India are evident. There is a wide distinction between city dwellers (the sophisticated urban population) and dwellers of under-resourced urban areas. The population in under-resourced urban areas has been increasing in India, with poor quality of life, limited digital access, and inadequate digital life facilities. As of 2022, the number of people living in under-resourced urban areas reached ~100 million, which is greater than the entire population of Australia (India Housing Report,2022). Under-resourced areas in Indian cities are widespread and attract a large population working in the unorganized sector, including those who are unemployed, homeless migrants, daily wage laborers, baggers, and vendors. We found a wide gap between the affluent residential areas of the city and under-resourced urban areas in terms of facilities, living conditions, and standards of living. People living in under-resourced urban areas are very poor. Although digitalization has penetrated under-resourced urban areas, it has not brought significant changes because people are already vulnerable in many social and economic aspects. People who live in under-resourced urban areas do not have access to digitalized education, e-health care, the digital economy, or technology-based skills. They own smartphones, but the study revealed that they mostly use them to consume popular culture and social media. Even school-going children are often found loitering and using mobile phones for various non-social and unethical activities.",
            "Their counterparts in the affluent residential areas of the city are enrolled in prestigious schools such as international schools, convent schools, and residential schools, among others. These schools are equipped with advanced digital technology, and students have no issues accessing digital facilities. However, children living in under-resourced urban areas face difficulties accessing digital facilities. The schools in which children from under-resourced urban areas are enrolled have inadequate physical infrastructure and digital infrastructure, and the academic environment is so poor that children often come only for midday meals (a government scheme for providing lunch to children). Most people who live in under-resourced urban areas have low literacy skills and lack any basic knowledge of the digital economy or technical skills. Their living conditions are so impoverished that socioeconomic development should be prioritized over digitalization. They prioritize access to drinking water, personal toilets, a hygienic house, and sanitation. We found that almost all households in under-resourced urban areas have access to television and smartphones, but this does not equate to digitalization. Under-resourced urban areas have been included in the digital market as consumers, but digitalization has not acted as an agent of socioeconomic transformation. Manual laborers with education up to at least secondary and senior secondary are switching to technical fields and undertaking training programs to upgrade their skills. However, in under-resourced urban areas, the highest level of education attained is often only up to the 12th grade. Most residents have either no literacy skills or have a limited education that barely allows them to write their own names. This significant digital divide between affluent city dwellers and those who live in under-resourced urban areas has made the challenge of creating a smart city even more difficult and uneven. Although a city may be considered smart, because digitalization has not been able to transform the entire urban society, it could be argued that a smart city lacks a smart society.",
            "India's digital divide is not just a technological challenge but a reflection of the country's longstanding socioeconomic disparities. Digital inclusion efforts must focus on developing the capabilities of all sections of society rather than simply expanding digital infrastructure. This requires a concentrated effort to improve educational attainment, socioeconomic status, and digital literacy. Without these efforts, the benefits of digitalization will not be fully realized. It is important to recognize that a smart city cannot exist in isolation from broader society, and efforts must be made to address the realities of under-resourced urban areas and other marginalized communities. Ultimately, the goal should be to create a smart society in line with the concept of Society 5.0, where technology is used to enhance the wellbeing of all members of society.",

A thorough analysis of the two newly enacted laws, i.e., the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020 and literature review support analysis of 290 online consumers answering the research questions and achieving research objectives. The significant findings are that a secure and reliable system is essential for e-business firms to work successfully; cash on delivery is the priority option for online shopping; website information and effective customer care services build a customer's trust. The new regulations are arguably strong enough to protect and safeguard online consumers' rights and boost India’s e-commerce growth. Besides factors such as security, privacy, warranty, customer service, and website information, laws governingconsumer rights protection in e-commerce influence customers’ trust. Growing e-commerce looks promising with a robust legal framework and consumer protection measures. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge on e-commerce and consumer rights protection by elucidating the key factors that affect customer trust and loyalty and offering an informative perspective on e-consumer protection in the Indian context with broader implications.",

            "Consumer protection is a burning issue in e-commerce throughout the globe. E-Commerce refers to a mechanism that mediates transactions to sell goods and services through electronic exchange. E-commerce increases productivity and widens choice through cost savings, competitiveness and a better production process organisation1(Vancauteren et al.,2011). According to the guidelines-1999 of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), e-commerce is online business activities-both communications, including advertising and marketing, and transactions comprising ordering, invoicing and payments (OECD,2000). OCED-1999 guidelines recognised, among others, three essential dimensions of consumer protection in e-commerce. All consumers need to have access to e-commerce. Second, to build consumer trust/confidence in e-commerce, the continued development of transparent and effective consumer protection mechanisms is required to check fraudulent, misleading, and unfair practices online. Third, all stakeholders-government, businesses, consumers, and their representatives- must pay close attention to creating effective redress systems. These guidelines are primarily for cross-border transactions (OECD,2000).",
            "Considering the technological advances, internet penetration, massive use of smartphones and social media penetration led e-commerce growth, the OECD revised its 1999 recommendations for consumer protection in 2016. The 2016-guidelines aim to address the growing challenges of e-consumers’ protection by stimulating innovation and competition, including non-monetary transactions, digital content products, consumers-to-consumers (C2C) transactions, mobile devices, privacy and security risks, payment protection and product safety. Furthermore, it emphasises the importance of consumer protection authorities in ensuring their ability to protect e-commerce consumers and cooperate in cross-border matters (OECD,2016). The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in its notes-2017, also recognises similar consumer protection challenges in e-commerce.

The reason for this is that India has become a leading country for online consumer fraud, putting a spotlight on electronic governance systems-which may have an impact on India's ease of doing business ranking.

            "E-commerce has been booming since the advent of the worldwide web (internet) in 1991, but its root is traced back to the Berlin Blockade for ordering and airlifting goods via telex between 24 June 1948 and 12 May 1949. Since then, new technological developments, improvements in internet connectivity, and widespread consumer and business adoption, e-commerce has helped countless companies grow. The first e-commerce transaction took place with the Boston Computer Exchange that launched its first e-commerce platform way back in 1982 (Azamat et al.,2011; Boateng et al.,2008). E-commerce growth potential is directly associated with internet penetration (Nielsen,2018). The increase in the worldwide use of mobile devices/smartphones has primarily led to the growth of e-commerce. With mobile devices, individuals are more versatile and passive in buying and selling over the internet (Harrisson et al.,2017; Išoraitė & Miniotienė,2018; Milan et al., (2020); Nielsen,2018; Singh,2019; UNCTAD,2019a,2019b). The growth of the millennial digital-savvy workforce, mobile ubiquity and continuous optimisation of e-commerce technology is pressing the hand and speed of the historically slow-moving B2B market. The nearly US$1 Billion B2B e-commerce industry is about to hit the perfect storm that is driving the growth of B2C businesses (Harrisson et al.,2017). Now, e-commerce has reshaped the global retail market (Nielsen,2019). The observation is that e-commerce is vibrant and an ever-expanding business model; its future is even more competitive than ever, with the increasing purchasing power of global buyers, the proliferation of social media users, and the increasingly advancing infrastructure and technology (McKinsey Global Institute,2019; UNCTAD,2019a,2019b).",
            "The analysis of the growth trend in e-commerce, especially since 2015, explains that online consumers continue to place a premium on both flexibility and scope of shopping online. With the convenience of buying and returning items locally, online retailers will increase their footprint (Harrisson et al.,2017). Today, e-commerce is growing across countries with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% between 2014 and 2020; it is likely to grow at 25% between 2020 and 2025. Further analysis of e-commerce business reveals that internet penetration will be nearly 60% of the population in 2020, and Smartphone penetration has reached almost 42%. Among the users, 31% are in the age group of 25–34 years old, followed by 24% among the 35–44 years bracket and 22% in 18–24 years. Such a vast infrastructure and networking have ensured over 70% of the global e-commerce activities in the Asia–Pacific region. While China alone accounts for US$740 billion, the USA accounts for over US$$560 billion (Kerick,2019). A review of global shoppers making online purchases (Fig.2) shows that consumers look beyond their borders-cross-border purchases in all regions. While 90% of consumers visited an online retail site by July 2020, 74% purchased a product online, and 52% used a mobile device.",

The size of e-commerce relative to the gross domestic product was 4.5% in the region by 2015. E-commerce enables small and medium-sized enterprises to reach global markets and compete on an international scale. It has improved economic efficiency and created many new jobs in developing economies and least developed countries, offering them a chance to narrow development gaps and increase inclusiveness—whether demographic, economic, geographic, cultural, or linguistic. It also helps narrow the rural–urban divide.",
            "Nevertheless, Asia’s e-commerce market remains highly heterogeneous. In terms of e-commerce readiness—based on the UNCTAD e-commerce index 2017, the Republic of Korea ranks fifth globally (score 95.5) while Afghanistan, with 17 points, ranks 132 (UNCTAD,2017). According to a joint study (2018) by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) and Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asia is the fastest-growing region in the global e-commerce marketplace. The region accounted for the largest share of the world’s business-to-consumer e-commerce market (UNESCAP and ADB, 2019). World Retail Congress (2019) brought out the Global E-Commerce Market Ranking 2019 assessing the top 30 ranking e-commerce markets on various parameters-USA, UK, China, Japan and Germany were the first top countries. India figured at 15 with a CAGR of 19.8% between 2018 and 2022.

The government’s Digital India drive beginning 1 July 2015-surge using mobile wallets like Paytm, Ola Money, Mobiwik, BHIM etc., and the declaration of demonetisation on 9 November 2016 appears to be the prime reasons for such a vast growth in the country’s e-commerce industry. The Times of India (2020 October 12), a daily leading Indian newspaper, reported that India's increase in digital payments was at a CAGR of 55.1% from March 2016 to March 2020, jumping from US$ 73,90 million to 470.40, reflecting the country's positive policy environment and preparedness for the digital economy.

            "The massive growth of e-commerce in countries worldwide, especially in India, has prompted an examination of the legal structure regulating online consumer protection.",
            "Generally speaking, customers, as treated inferior to their contracting partners, need protection (Daniel,2005). Therefore, due to low bargaining power, it is agreed that their interests need to be secured. The ‘inequality of negotiating power’ theory emphasises the consumer's economically weaker status than suppliers (Haupt,2003; Liyang,2019; Porter,1979). The ‘inequality in bargaining power’ principle emphasises the customer's economically inferior position to suppliers (Haupt,2003). The ‘exploitation theory’ also supports a similar view to the ‘weaker party’ argument. According to this theory, for two reasons, consumers need protection: first, consumers have little choice but to buy and contract on the terms set by increasingly large and powerful businesses; second, companies can manipulate significant discrepancies in knowledge and complexity in their favour (Cockshott & Dieterich,2011). However, a researcher such as Ruhl (2011) believed that this conventional theoretical claim about defining the customer as the weaker party is no longer valid in modern times. The logic was that the exploitation theory did not take into account competition between firms. Through competition from other businesses, any negotiating power that companies have vis-a-vis clients is minimal. The study, therefore, considers that the ‘economic theory’ is the suitable theoretical rationale for consumer protection today.",
            "The principle of ‘economic philosophy’ focuses primarily on promoting economic productivity and preserving wealth as a benefit (Siciliani et al.,2019). As such, the contract law had to change a great deal to deal with modern-age consumer transactions where there is no delay between agreement and outcomes (McCoubrey  & White,1999). Thus, the ‘economic theory’ justifies the flow of goods and services through electronic transactions since online markets' versatility and rewards are greater than those of face-to-face transactions. The further argument suggests that a robust consumer protection framework can provide an impetus for the growth of reliability and trust in electronic commerce. The ‘incentive theory’ works based on that argument to describe consumer protection in electronic transactions (McCoubrey & White,1999).",
            "Online shopping needs greater trust than purchasing offline (Nielsen,2018). From the viewpoint of ‘behavioural economics, trust (faith/confidence) has long been considered a trigger for buyer–seller transactions that can provide high standards of fulfilling trade relationships for customers (Pavlou,2003). Pavlou (2003) supports the logical reasoning of Lee and Turban (2001) that the role of trust is of fundamental importance in adequately capturing e-commerce customer behaviour. The study by O'Hara (2005) also suggests a relationship between law and trust (belief/faith), referred to as ‘safety net evaluation’, suggesting that law may play a role in building trust between two parties. However, with cross-border transactions, the constraint of establishing adequate online trust increases, especially if one of the parties to the transaction comes from another jurisdiction with a high incidence of counterfeits or a weak rule of law (Loannis et al.,2019). Thus, the law promotes the parties' ability to enter into a contractual obligation to the extent that it works to reduce a contractual relationship's insecurity. The present research uses the idea of trust (faith/belief/confidence) as another theoretical context in line with ‘behavioural economics’.",
            "As a focal point in e-commerce, trust refers to a party's ability to be vulnerable to another party's actions; the trustor, with its involvement in networking, sees trust in the form of risk-taking activity (Mayer et al.,1995; Helge et al.,2020). Lack of confidence could result in weak contracts, expensive legal protections, sales loss and business failure. Therefore, trust plays a crucial role in serving customers transcend the perceived risk of doing business online and in helping them become susceptible, actual or imaginary, to those inherent e-business risks. While mutual benefit is usually the reason behind a dealing/transaction, trust is the insurance or chance that the customer can receive that profit (Cazier,2007). The level of trust can be low or high. Low risk-taking behaviour leads to lower trustor engagement, whereas high risk-taking participation leads to higher trustor engagement (Helge et al.,2020). The theory of trust propounded by (Mayer et al.,1995) suggests that trust formation depends on three components, viz. ability, benevolence, and integrity (ABI model). From the analysis of the previous studies (Mayer et al.,1995; Cazier,2007; Helge et al.,2020), the following dimensions of the ABI model emerge:",
            "Precisely,ability, benevolence and integrityhave a direct influence on the trust of e-commerce customers.",
            "Gaining the trust of consumers and developing a relationship has become more challenging for e-businesses. The primary reasons are weak online security, lack of effectiveness of the electronic payment system, lack of effective marketing program, delay in delivery, low quality of goods and services, and ineffective return policy (Kamari  & Kamari,2012; Mangiaracina & Perego,2009). These weaknesses adversely impact business operations profoundly later. Among the challenges that are the reasons for the distrust of customers and downsides of e-commerce is that the online payment mechanism is widely insecure. The lack of trust in electronic payment is the one that impacts negatively on the e-commerce industry, and this issue is still prevalent (Mangiaracina  & Perego,2009). The revelation of a recent study (Orendorff,2019) and survey results9on trust-building, particularly about the method of payment, preferred language and data protection, is fascinating. The mode of payment is another matter of trust-building. Today’s customers wish to shop in their local currency seamlessly. In an online shoppers’ survey of 30,000 respondents in 2019, about 92% of customers preferred to purchase in their local currency, and 33% abandoned a buy if pricing was listed in US$ only (Orendorff,2019). Airbnb, an online accommodation booking e-business that began operations in 2009, has expanded and spread its wings globally as of September 2020-over 220 countries and 100 k + cities serving 7 + billion customers (guests) with local currency payment options.10",
            "Common Sense Advisory Survey11-Nov. 2019-Feb. 2020 with 8709 online shoppers (B2C) in 29 countries, reported that 75% of them preferred to purchase products if the information was in their native language. About 60% confirmed that they rarely/never bought from an English-only website because they can’t read. Similarly, its survey of 956 business people (B2B) moved in a similar direction. Whether it is B2B or B2C customers, they wanted to go beyond Google translator-this is about language being a front-line issue making or breaking global sales. Leading Indian e-commerce companies like Amazon12and Flipkart13have started capturing the subsequent 100 million users by providing text and voice-based consumer support in vernacular languages. These observations suggest trust in information that the customers can rely upon for a successful transaction.",
            "Data protection is probably the most severe risk of e-commerce. The marketplaces witness so many violations that it often seems that everyone gets hacked, which makes it a real challenge to guarantee that your store is safe and secure. For e-commerce firms, preserving the data is a considerable expense; it points a finger to maintaining the safety and security of the e-commerce consumers’ data privacy in compliance with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) across countries.14",
            "PwC’s Global Consumer Insight Survey 2020 reports that while customers’ buying habits would become more volatile post-COVID 19, consumers’ experience requires safety, accessibility, and digital engagement would be robust and diversified.15The report reveals that the COVID-19 outbreak pushed the popularity of mobile shopping. Online grocery shopping (including phone use) has increased by nearly 63% post-COVID than before social distancing execution and is likely to increase to 86% until its removal. Knowing the speed of market change will place companies in a position to handle the disruption-74% of the work is from home, at least for the time being. Again, the trend applies to consumers’ and businesses’ confidence/trust-building. The safety and security of customers or consumer protection are of paramount importance.",
            "Given the rationale above, the doctrine of low bargaining power, exploitation theory and the economic approach provides the theoretical justification for consumer protection. Economic theory also justifies electronic transactions and e-commerce operations as instruments for optimising income. The trust theory based on behavioural economic conception also builds up the relationship between the law and customer trust and thus increases confidence in the online market. These premises form the basis for this research.",
            "The law of the land guides people and the living society. Prevailing rules and regulations, when followed, provide peace of mind and security in all spheres, including business activities (Bolton et al.,2004). Previous research by Young & Wilkinson (1989) suggested that those who have more legally strict contracts face more legal problems in contrast to trust-related issues (Young & Wilkinson,1989). Time has changed; people going for online transactions go with the legal framework and feel safe and secured (Bolton et al.,2004). An online agreement is a valid contract. Most UNCTAD member countries, including India, have adopted various laws concerning e-governance/e-business/e-society, such as e-transaction laws, consumer protection laws, cyber-crime laws, and data privacy and protection laws. The trend indicates that the law is vital in establishing trust in online transactions.",
            "A review of literature on e-commerce and consumer protection suggests that over the years, consumer protection in e-commerce has received significant attention, particularly from the regulatory authorities-government agencies, trade associations and other associated actors (Belwal et al.,2020; Cortés,2010; Dhanya,2015; Emma et al.,2017; Ibidapo-Obe,2011; ITU,2018; Jaipuriar et al.,2020; Rothchild,1999; Saif,2018).

An objective review of 36 highly rated (Scopus/Web Services/ABDC Ranking or the like) e-commerce related publications from over 100 articles published in the last 20 years (2000–2020) suggests that the vast majority of earlier studies in this field have been conceptual/theoretical and generic. Regarding the legal framework of e-commerce and consumers’ rights protection, six current papers exclusively in the Indian context were available for analysis and review. The observations are that while the focus on consumer privacy and rights protection concerns is too general, the legal framework's scrutiny has limited its scope. A review of selected studies on trust and consumer rights protection in e-commerce, as shown in Table3, reveals that application aspects, particularly legal issues, are lacking. Indian experience in e-commerce consumer rights protection through jurisprudence is nascent. Review studies show the research of a combination of management and law-related analysis in e-commerce and consumer rights protection is lacking. This scenario showed a gap in exploring a more comprehensive research opportunity in the Indian context.",

            "While e-commerce and electronic transactions have evolved as a global trend, it is noteworthy that Indian customers are still reluctant to place complete confidence and trust in commercial online transactions. Compared to conventional offline customers, online customers face greater risk in cyberspace because they negotiate with unknown vendors and suppliers.16The common issues17related to e-commerce are data privacy and security, product quality, uncertain delivery, no/low scope of replacement, the jurisdiction of filing complaints, and inconceivable terms and conditions (Lahiri,2018). “Country of origin” of the product is a significant issue in e-commerce, particularly in cross-border transactions (Bhattacharya et al.,2020). The inadequacy of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 and other associated laws has surged the insecurity and lack of trust among online customers. The significance of digital payments pursued by the Government of India's essential demonetisation policy-2016 has pushed for online transaction security and consumer protection in e-commerce activities. Therefore, the Consumer Protection Act, 201918replaced the Consumer Protection Act 1986 and became effective with effect from 20 July 2020,19while on 7 July 2020, the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 202020came into force to address the e-commerce challenges. Nevertheless, it was evident that to attract additional investment and to engage with the global market, India, as an emerging country, had to gain the confidence of e-consumers.",

Like theABI model, the study also examines the factors influencing e-commerce customers' confidence in the present research context.",
            "The research initially depended on the rigorous review of the consumer protection guidelines released from time to time by various bodies, such as the OECD and UNCATD, accompanied by an analysis of the Indian consumer protection legal structure. The Indian Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020 were the review and analysis subjects.

(2013) about the representative of convenience sampling and bias, we consider it is similar to that of the population, and there is no harm with due care. Regarding inherent bias in convenience sampling, data collection from different sources with different respondents’ inclusion provides more data variability and considerably reduces prejudice (Sousa et al.,2004; Edgar and Manz,2017). Therefore, the respondents included in the research were students, professors, advocates, doctors, professionals, and homemakers, avoiding excluding family, relatives and friends to ensure bias-free. Their contact details sources were various channels, including public institution websites, social networking sites, and the authors’ email box. Assuming that more respondents feel fun filling out online questionnaires and providing truthful answers (Chen & Barnes,2007; Saunders et al.,2007), the study used an online survey. Furthermore, because people in the digital age are more computer/smartphone savvy, they are more likely to follow a similar trend. Besides, such a technique was convenient during the COVID-19 pandemic condition because of its timeliness, inexpensive methods, ease of research, low cost (no support for this research), readily available, and fewer rules to follow. The respondents' contact details sources were various channels, including public institution websites, social networking sites, and the authors' email box.",

Pretesting the questionnaire with 17 responses from the target group supported modifying the final questionnaire partially. The first four questions were background questions-gender, age, respondent's attitude towards internet purchasing. Question number five with sub-questions, being the focused question, provided the answer to some trust-building factors found in the literature review. Following previous research (McKnight et al.,2002; Corbit et al.,2003; Pavlou,2003) tested the Likert-scale, this question's solicited response relied on a five-point Likert-rating scale (1 = Not important at all, 2 = Less important, 3 = Somewhat important, 4 = Important, 5 = Very important). The query six asked was about the consumer protection issues in e-commerce/online transaction-scam/fraud and grievance settlement. The final question seven was open-ended for any remark the respondent wanted to make.

Since the Act is new, it would be premature to comment on its operational aspects and effectiveness. In a recent judgement in Consumer Complaint No 883 of 2020 (M/s Pyaridevi Chabiraj Steels Pvt. Ltd vs National Insurance Company Ltd, the NCDRC21has proved the Act's operational effectiveness by deciding the maintainability of a claim's jurisdiction based on the new Act's provisions. However, it is inevitable that \"beware buyer\" will be replaced by \"beware seller/manufacturer\"; the consumer will be the real king. The Rules 2020 strike a balance between the responsibilities of e-commerce business owners and on-the-platform vendors. Contravention, if any, of the new regulation/rules would invite the provisions of the Act 2019. The observation is that limited liability partnerships are missing from the e-commerce entities. However, with the Act and Rules' operational experience, the judiciary or legislature will address this issue sooner or later.",
            "Nevertheless, the Rules 2020 provide a robust legal framework to build consumers' trust in e-commerce transactions and protect their rights and interests, thereby proving the notion, \"consumer is the king\". The COVID-19 impact has pushed the government to adopt and encourage online compliant filling procedures through the National Consumer Helpline. Using various APPs is likely to expedite the adjudication process and benefit the aggrieved consumer and build trust in the governance system.",
            "Reading the Rules, 2020, with the Act, 2019, the observation is that by making smartphones the primary target of the new legislation, the Act, 2019 is hailed as an all-inclusive regulatory regime that would raise customer interest investment in e-commerce. To safeguard consumers' rights in all modern-day retail commerce models, the Act, 2019 attempts to turn the jurisprudence pervading consumer protectionism from a caveat emptor to a caveat seller. In addition, the Act formally incorporated e-commerce within its limits and entered the realm of B2C e-commerce. One crucial takeaway benefit for consumers is simplifying the complaint filing process, enabling consumers to file complaints online and redress grievances.",
            "E-commerce has become a gift to all customers in the COVID-19 pandemic's aftermath. The E-Commerce Rules, 2020 follow the stringent consumer protection regime under the new Act, 2019. In the raging pandemic, the timing of the E-Commerce Rules, 2020 is beneficial considering the current limitations on customers' freedom of travel and increased reliance on e-commerce. The grievances redress mechanism as provided in the Rules, 2020 is indubitably a calibrated step ensuring neutrality in the e-commerce market place, greater transparency, stringent penalties and a striking balance between the commitments of e-commerce firms and vendors in the marketplace. The mandatory provisions of appointing a consumer grievance redress officer and a nodal contact person or an alternative senior appointed official (resident in India) with contact details, acknowledging consumer complaints within 48 h of receipt with a ticket number, and resolving complaints within 1 month of receipt are unquestionably beneficial to consumers. Although each e-commerce company has its refund policy, all refund claims must have a timely settlement. However, anxiety abounds as daily online fraud and unethical trading practices have made consumers fearful of exposing themselves to unscrupulous vendors and service providers. Moreover, the regulations' effective enforcement would dissuade unethical retailers and service providers, thereby building consumer trust, which time will see.",
            "The practical contributions of the paper emerge from survey findings. Concerning the primary survey, the male–female ratio is nearly 1:1, with an average age of 36 years in the age range of 20–65. As regards profession, 67% were working professionals, and 22% were students. While all of the respondents were computer/tablet/mobile-savvy, 96% had at least a five-time online shopping experience during the last 7 months between January–July 2020. The desktop with 61% response is still the preferred device for online shopping. The pricing with cash on delivery, shipping convenience, and quality reviews determined online shopping factors. About 57% of them agreed that COVID-19 impacted their online purchase habits and pushed for online transactions even though they feared insecurity about online shopping. The primary concerns were low-quality products at a high price, a refund for defective products, and a delay in settlement of wrong/excess payments. The top five leading e-commerce platforms reported were Amazon, Flipkart, Alibaba, Myntra, and IndiaMart. Netmeds was also a leading e-commerce business platform in the pharmaceutical sector. During the COVID-19 pandemic, JioMart was very popular for home-delivery food products, groceries and vegetables in the metro locality. The customer feedback system was found robust on Amazon.",
            "The respondents' trust in online shopping reveals that a secure and reliable system was essential for 93% of the respondents. For nearly the same proportion, information about how e-business firms work provided security solutions was a priority factor. Choosing a payment option, 76% of the respondents prioritised “cash on delivery-online transfer at the doorstep. Regarding the privacy of personal information shared by online shoppers, 52% said that they cared about this aspect. Factors like warranty and guarantee (67%) and customer service (69%) were important factors of trust-building with the e-entities. Information on the websites (easy navigation/user friendly and reviews) was either important or very important, with 77% of the respondents’ confidence building to buy online. Information about the product features and its manufacturer/supplier was essential to 86% of the respondents for trust-building on the product and the supplier (manufacture) and e-commerce entity. Along with the ABI model discussed above, the presumption is that security, privacy, warranty/guarantee, customer service, and website information factors positively influence e-commerce customers' trust.",
            "Multiple regression analysis suggests that as theP= value of every independent variable is below 0.05% level of significance, the independent variables security, privacy, warranty, customer service, and website information are all significant. Alternatively, the overallPvalue of 0.032 withR20.82 supports the presumption that security, privacy, warranty/guarantee, customer service, website information factors have a combined influence on e-commerce customers' trust.",
            "Given this backdrop, Table6summarises the micro findings on respondents' online shopping behaviour, their trust and safety aspects, and understanding of the provisions of the new Act, 2019 and Rules, 2020. The higher mean value for a sub-factor implies higher importance attached to the factor by the respondents.Pvalue at a 5% level of significance explains an individual element's contribution to trust-building behaviour for online buying.",
            "Statistical analysis of online shopping trust factors (N= 290)",
            "Pvalue = 0.032",
            "R2=0.82",
            "The first observation from the data analysis is that, comparatively, the younger generation is prone to online shopping; it goes along with Xiaodong and Min (2020). Secondly, the respondents of all age groups have online buying experience even in a pandemic situation forced by COVID-19, compromising their safety and security concerns. The third observation is that factors like “cash on the delivery option (COD)”, adequate information on the e-commerce entity corporate website, and effective grievance/complaint redress mechanism are the three crucial factors that build consumers’ trust in e-commerce transactions. The reason probably is that this Act and Rules are new and significant dispute (s) could yet be reported seeking invoking the relevant provisions of the Act and Rules in an appropriate legal forum.",
            "Further, the logical observation of the COD option being a perceived influential factor in trust-building emanates from the fact that protection and security are the essential elements that make customers hesitant toward utilizing other e-payment options. The studies by Mekovec and Hutinski (2012), Maqableh (2015) and Ponte et al.(2015); have similar views. However, post-demonetization (2016), India is growing with more digital payments. In this context, we value Harvard researchers Bandi et al. (2017) contention that customers who switch to digital payments maintain their purchasing recurrence but spend more and are less likely to restore their purchases. The firms in emerging markets may appreciate gains from customer interest, notwithstanding operational increases from payment digitalization. The coherent perception about the impact of website information on trust-building is in line with the findings of Brian et al. (2019) that the online information source creates a spill-over effect on satisfaction and trust toward the retailer. The implication of the need for an effective grievance redress mechanism is that trust-building would be a tricky proposition if the company cannot ensure dedicated and tailored customer service and support. Kamari and Kamari (2012) and Mangiaracina and Perego (2009) had comparative perspectives likewise.",
            "The final observation is that the level of trust required to engage in online shopping/transaction varies among the respondents depending on their trust perception level. The younger generation, less than 35 years old, is more risk-taking when it comes to pre-purchase online payment, but women over 45 years old are a little hesitant and prefer to do their online shopping with payment at the time of placing an order. This is ostensibly because the younger generation is more tuned to network connectivity via smartphone/tablet, and they perceive online transactions as less dangerous. The present research findings on the influence of security, privacy, warranty/guarantee, customer service, and website information on e-commerce customers' confidence-building support the earlier discussed ABI model proposition (Mayer et al.,1995; Cazier,2007; Helge et al.,2020). TheR2-value of 0.82 implies that there are other factors beyond what is studied. The other probable factor (s) that might have influenced trust is the new Act and Rules' effectiveness in protecting online consumers' interests. The new regulations need a couple of years (at least 2 years) of operational experience for proper assessment. The Act 2019 appears robust to protect consumer rights and interests of e-commerce customers with specific regulations (i.e. Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020) in force, helping the country's economic growth.",
            "The study variably supports Nehf (2007) view that consumers make decisions about distributing their data in exchange for different benefits like, e.g., information on web sites and access to databases. Trust, credibility, privacy issues, security concerns, the nature of the information on the website, and the e-commerce firm's reputation directly influence consumers' internet trust (Kim et al.,2008). Trust is the focal point of online consumers' decision-making; the observation endorses  Larose and Rifon (2007) creation of privacy alerts as part of consumer privacy self-regulation initiatives and the use of a social cognitive model to consider consumer privacy behaviours. Besides, data privacy and trust breaches adversely affect the firm's market value (Tripathi & Mukhopadhyay,2020) also hold good in the present context. Figure7demonstrates a diagrammatic model of trust of the consumer on e-commerce transactions leading to his decision-making.",
            "Model for consumers’ trust on e-commerce transactions",
            "Every research has more or less some limitations; this one has too. The main impediment was the non-availability of adequate literature defining the impact assessment of the legal framework of consumer protection measures in e-commerce. The probable reasoning is that the Acts/Laws governing e-commerce and online consumer rights protection under consideration are new; ethical dispute resolution and judicial interventions have only recently begun. Sample size limitation is also a hindering factor in the generalisation of the findings. The observations and managerial insights are likely to change with a few more years of implementation experience of the Acts.",
            "Lack of trust in goods and their suppliers/manufacturers was one of the primary reasons for people not buying online. The widespread internet penetration and the growing use of computer/tablets/smartphones have pushed e-commerce growth across countries, including India. The rapid e-commerce development has brought about new distribution methods. It has provided new opportunities for consumers, forcing consumers vulnerable to new forms of unfair trade and unethical business. Further, the government's measures to protect consumer rights, particularly online consumers, are inadequate. Hence, the government enacted the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 and the Consumer Protection (E-commerce) Rules, 2020 and made them effective from July 2020. The new Act and Rules have less than 6 months of operational experience, implying premature comment on its effectiveness in providing safety and security to online consumers. However, online consumers' positive responses suggest that people gain confidence in online shopping with safety and security. Because consumer rights protection is paramount in the growth of e-commerce, the new regulations strengthen the grievance redress mechanism of online consumers, ensuring their trust-building ability, safety, and security. The \"Consumer is the King with power\" now. The new reform, i.e., enactment of the two laws, aids in doing business too. Some legal complications may arise with more operational experience in the future. Still, with judiciary intervention and directives, the online consumer's safety and security will pave the growth of e-commerce in India.",
            "Some stakeholders have apprehension about the new Act and Rules' effectiveness because of the slow judiciary process, inadequate infrastructure support, and corrupt practices. The findings provide some practical implications for consumer activists, policymakers, and research communities to explore how to strengthen trust-building among online consumers. Regarding theoretical implications, the research improves the scientific community's understanding of the existing body of knowledge about online trust and e-consumer protection. The article further contributes to the body of literature on e-commerce and consumer protection, understanding the crucial factors impacting customer trust and loyalty and provides an insightful perspective on e-consumer protection in the Indian context on the eve of the new legislation enacted in 2019–2020.",
            "Given the presumption that e-commerce and trust are areas of constant change, trust in e-commerce will change, and it will be more challenging to integrate e-commerce into people's lives. The scope for further research to test the effectiveness of the Act, 2019, and Rule, 2020 in redressing e-commerce consumers' grievances and protecting their rights is wider only after a couple of years of operational experience. The government's policy drive for accelerating online transactions also poses challenges considering the importance of trust-building and consumer rights protection in e-commerce. Future research would shed more light on these issues.",
