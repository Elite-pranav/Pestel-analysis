            "Our PESTLE analysis of Tesla Inc. contains key factors that influence the electric car company, along with 6 little-known facts!",
            "On this page, we are conducting a PESTLE analysis of Tesla to examine how political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors affect the electric vehicle company. Did you know that Tesla, which has expanded its Supercharging network to nearly 6,000 stations by the end of 2023, sent a car into space in 2018? Elon Musk himself owned the roadster, which he used to commute to work before launching it into space! Time to see if that marketing stunt was the result of external factors affecting the electric vehicle company.",
            "Our PESTLE analysis of Tesla starts like every other PESTLE analysis: analyzing 8 political factors that affect the Tesla company. Prepare yourself for a lot of political jargon and international policies in this part!",
            "But enough talk of mundane political factors. Let’s talk about three specific political developments that acted like speed boosts (or speed bumps) for Tesla to get a better understanding of how politics can influence them.",

            "Well, now you know and we now move into the second section of our PESTLE analysis of Tesla. Here we explore how 10 economic factors influence Tesla.",
            "Recently, the electric car market has grown exponentially. Global electric car sales surged. They crossed over 3 million units in a single year for the first time in 2020. They nearly doubled to around 6.6 million units in 2021 and surpassed 10 million units in 2022.",
            "This growth obviously suggests a robust and expanding market. People demand more electric cars, technology advances, and governments around the world favor EV's adoption.",
            "What’s more, the market value of the electric car sector has skyrocketed. The industry's value is estimated to be in the hundreds of billions. In the meantime, projections point towards it reaching over $800 billion by 2027. This is because of investments in EV technology and people being more interested in greener transportation options.",

            "Technology is both a friend and foe to Tesla.",
            "As a friend, it helps the company maintain a competitive edge. It allows Tesla to be fuel efficient and paves the way for future sustainability and usability.Unlike traditional optionsin the automotive industry, the cars are made to adopt newer technology.",
            "But the company also has to be on edge.",
            "It doesn’t take much for technology to become obsolete. We are constantly creating, developing, and advancing what we already have. Thanks to upgrades and updates, the newest gadgets and apps can be absolutely useless in a year. Since Tesla relies on technology for its vehicles, this is both a positive and negative point for the vehicles.",
            "However, Tesla is in a great Position to implementartificial intelligence (AI) and automation into their vehicles. Many traditional cars aren’t built for such advancements, but Tesla makes sure its cars are ready to adopt them (up until they advancetoofar).",

        "title": "Third time’s the charm for Tesla? What we know about Elon Musk company’s plans to enter the Indian market - Hindustan Times",
        "paragraphs": [
            "The airwaves are abuzz once again with the news of EV giant Tesla entering India, after two prior failed attempts. Following Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tesla has reportedly begun producing vehicles that it intends to import to the India market, while also scouting for potential locations to set-up a factory, although neither Musk nor any other sources have confirmed this.",
            "In March 2024, the Indian government introduced a policy permitting EV manufacturers to import fully assembled electric vehicles (Completely Built Units or CBUs) at a reduced customs duty rate of 15%, applicable for a period of five years. Under this policy, a foreign EV maker can import up to 40,000 units at a lower custom duty rate of 15%, with a maximum import limit of 8,000 units per year. The deal works only if the manufacturer invests $500 million dollars in India, which would involve setting-up a factory.",
            "Although Tesla’s initial plans will involve importing cars from its Berlin plant, the greater benefit lies in Tesla’s ability to enrich India’s EV supply chain. Thus far, Tesla has been using India as a components stronghold, sourcing nearly $1 billion in auto components from India in 2023. Components such as plastic parts, casting, differential hubs etc. Given that US President Donald Trump has expressed his disapproval over Musk setting-up a factory in India, it’s more likely that Musk will continue to mine India for components, while utilising the country’s five-year policy to gauge consumer interest while also observing if India can effectively serve as an export-hub for Tesla’s yet-to-be-manufactured low-cost vehicle.",
            "Also read: Elon Musk's Tesla likely to begin India rollout through imported EVs: Report",
            "However, the question arises as to why Musk has decided to expedite Tesla’s long-dormant India operations. Despite a favourable policy environment which allowed Tesla to import cars at lowered custom duty, Musk’s plans to come to India were cancelled at the last minute, earlier last year with no indication of resuming talks. Now however, Tesla has listed 13 new positions across Delhi and Mumbai. What are the forces that could have possibly precipitated the circumstances around Tesla’s impending arrival in India?",
            "One of the key reasons behind Musk’s turnabout when it comes to the Indian EV market is that Tesla is witnessing a major sales slowdown, not just in the US, which continues to be its largest market, but also in countries like UK, Germany and France. Sales in the latter two countries were hit particularly hard. In January 2025, Tesla saw a 59.5 % sales decline in Germany and an even higher 63.3 % drop in France. Earlier this month Tesla shares dropped by 11% and it appears that its other key market China, Tesla’s largest market outside the US, saw an 11.5% year-on-year decline in sales in January 2025.",
            "The reasons are manifold and not limited to Musk’s politics alone. EVs are facing a global slowdown in sales, and Tesla’s aging car line-up hasn’t helped it beat its competitors. Partly, this is due to the fact that Tesla’s attention has been more focused on reshaping itself as a robotics and AI-driven company that makes cars.",
            "Models like the Cybertruck, which initially sold in vast quantities in the US, have not proven to have long-term durability. The Cybertruck has also faced major regulatory hurdles in markets like the UK, Japan, and EU region owing to its shape and size and its failure to comply with road safety standards. That, coupled with other reliability issues consistent with Tesla cars and the mounting competition from manufacturers like BYD, Volkswagen, and Hyundai, has ensured that Tesla no longer possesses the edge it once did.",
            "If Tesla is to indeed enter the market by the second quarter of this year, it will be doing so at a time when its brand cache is at an all-time low, with competitors matching steps with the brand and consumers boycotting Musk over his politics. At present, India remains the market where Tesla’s halo effect is the strongest. While there’s no doubt that there will be pent-up demand for the brand Tesla, it remains to be seen if it will be at all significant in a niche market like India, where even a base Tesla Model 3 will qualify as a luxury vehicle.",
            "Even with the import duty set to 15%, an entry-level Tesla Model 3 will cost roughly₹44.2 lakh (ex-showroom). Without the promise of local manufacturing, at a reduced import duty of 70%, Tesla will have far fewer takers despite strong brand cache in India, and pent-up demand as the Model 3 will cost upwards of₹65 lakh. Brand cache notwithstanding, competitors like Hyundai, Kia, BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz can offer far more robustly built products at that price point. And given regulations, Tesla's self-driving tech will not serve as an advantage over the competition.",
            "On the whole Tesla’s entry into India is a good thing for the entire ecosystem. Reports suggest that several suppliers are already scouting for locations in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Given that Tesla’s arrival will attract more high-end component players from Europe, means that the supply chain for EVs will be more robust than ever. In any case, Musk must comply with the policy framework which enables lower duty imports only via the promise of local manufacturing and 50% local component sourcing.",
            "Tesla may not have outrightly announced any plans to set up manufacturing, but it does intend to embed itself more deeply into the Indian market and make it a more integral part of its global operations. If not through outright sales, Tesla’s inadvertent strengthening of the EV supply chain can accelerate EV adoption in India.",
            "Let’s face it, this isn’t the first time Musk has announced something and not followed through. The Cybertruck’s launch saw significant delays, and the highly anticipated second-generation Tesla Roadster has yet to make an appearance. Even last year’s Cybercab unveiling is still some time away from being production-ready, and Musk’s claims of making fully autonomous tech road legal in the US are far from reliable.",
            "Also read: Tesla hiring in India: After Mumbai, Musk's company offering job in this city | What is it, who can apply, how to apply",
            "Even ifMuskuses his influence in the current US administration to bulldoze regulatory hurdles, it will be a while before a Model 2-level, sub₹21 lakh product will be production ready. While the average gestation period for a Tesla model from conception to production has been over 3 years, in recent times Tesla has taken much longer to bring its products out. Even Robin Zeng, CEO of Chinese battery giant and Tesla battery supplier CATL, stated that while Musk was on the right track with the Cybercab, it would be foolish to believe that it will be production-ready by 2026. For a Model 2 vehicle, Tesla would need to manufacture at an unprecedented scale, and that’s likely to take a lot of time.",
            "Even existing models like the Model Y have seen extensive delivery delays owing to supply chain issues (in China) and delayed deliveries in markets like Europe.",
            "That remains the big question. Although Tesla’s job listings for India show an intent to establish a strong customer service network in India, India’s demand for luxury EVs remains remarkably low for the world’s third-largest car market. From January to September 2024, Mercedes-Benz India – the long-standing market leader in the luxury space only sold 800 EV units out of a total of over 14,000 cars sold.",
            "Even though the demand for luxury EVs is rising in India, Tesla will fall considerably short of the 8000-unit cap when it comes to EV sales. Furthermore, there has been no talk of establishing a country-wide Supercharger network – something that is a lifeline for all Tesla buyers and a major reason behind Tesla’s global success. In order to truly accelerate EV adoption in India, Tesla would have to help set up “Superchargers” – its proprietary brand of fast DC chargers, at least on the busiest highway networks in India.",
            "Until then, Teslas will only serve as an embellishment on Indian roads. While Tesla might give the EV market in India a much-needed boost, perhaps even enhancing the overall appeal of electric vehicles – the systemic issues preventing EVs from selling in higher numbers will take much longer to iron out."

            "The automotive and transportation industry faces numerous legal challenges, especially as it navigates new technologies, regulations and global markets in 2025.\nHere are 10 top legal and policy issues currently affecting the industry and likely to have significant impact in the coming year:",
            "1.",
            "Autonomous Vehicle (AV) Regulation",
            "As self-driving cars become more common, legal questions arise about liability in accidents, insurance, safety standards and regulatory frameworks. Different jurisdictions have varied regulations, creating legal complexities. For example, the new EU AI Act emphasizes that high-risk AI systems must have appropriate human oversight mechanisms. AV manufacturers will need to incorporate fail-safe systems that allow a human to take control of the vehicle in emergencies or if the AI system malfunctions.",
            "2.",
            "Connectivity, Data Privacy and Security",
            "With the fitting of eSIM cards in vehicles\n            and the increasing amount of data generated by connected vehicles (telematics, driver\n            behavior, location tracking, over-the-air software updates), issues related to data privacy,\n            cybersecurity, localization and compliance with laws like telecom laws, the General\n            Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) are\n            critical. The question as to whether an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) needs\n            to obtain a telecom license or authorization to import connected vehicles fitted with an\n            eSIM telematic control unit (TCU) and to provide connected car services depends on\n            the type of services being provided (machine to machine (M2M), Wi-Fi internet access\n            or telephony), the jurisdiction where the car is used (some countries require a telecom\n            permit to import cars fitted with a TCU that receives national radio frequency as if it\n            was telecom equipment), and the type of business model being used for providing\n            connected car services to the user (direct, resale or agency). In the US, we may expect\n            increased US regulation on imports of connected vehicles, driven by concerns over data\n            access from foreign governments (e.g. China).",
            "3.",
            "Environmental Compliance and Emissions Standards",
            "Automakers must meet\n            stringent environmental regulations, including fuel efficiency standards and carbon\n            emissions limits. Legal risks arise from failure to comply, as well as lawsuits related\n            to emission fraud (e.g., the “dieselgate” scandal). President-elect Trump is likely to\n            overturn the Biden administration’s miles per gallon and emissions rules and try to\n            remove California’s authority to have more stringent standards. This is likely to result in\n            continued uncertainty for OEMs in the US market.",
            "4.",
            "Product Liability",
            "The risk of liability for defective products remains a key issue,\n            especially with the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and new technologies like battery\n            safety and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).",
            "5.",
            "Intellectual Property (IP) Protection",
            "As the automotive industry becomes more reliant on\n            software and digital technologies, protecting IP, including patents related to AI, AVs and EV\n            technology, is crucial. This is a completely different world from the one the automotive and\n            transportation industry is used to, suddenly faced with dealing with telecom standards and patents,\n            which require licensing. Disputes over patent rights and technology licensing can be costly.",
            "6.",
            "Labor and Employment Law",
            "Labor issues in the automotive industry are critical, particularly with union negotiations, automation and the shift toward EVs that may reduce jobs in traditional manufacturing. Legal challenges also arise from worker safety regulations and employee classifications. In a market in which competition for tech talent might become ever more important in this industry, particular attention should be paid to avoiding protections that could be seen as anticompetitive wage fixing or “no poach” agreements.",
            "7.",
            "Supply Chain Disruptions and Trade Regulations",
            "The automotive supply chain is complex and global, with legal issues related to tariffs, sanctions, trade agreements, and disruptions (e.g., due to geopolitical tensions). Compliance with international trade laws is vital. GCs in this industry will recall that back in 2016, when Trump was in the White House, a series of tariffs were imposed on auto parts and vehicles imported from China – 25% on Chinese-made vehicles, including cars, trucks and auto parts imported from China. Fast-forward to 2024, and these have not only remained unchanged, but as of 2024, the Biden administration has announced plans to increase the tariff on EVs imported from China from 25% to 100%. Trump’s focus on making America great again – it was one of his campaign slogans along with “Made in America” – makes it very believable that his administration will maintain the current 100% tariff proposal on EVs manufactured in China. It remains to be seen how China, Europe and the UK will react. President-elect Trump is also likely to increase tariffs on imports from China, potentially applying a universal tariff of 10% on all imports, and potentially seeking to change automotive rules of origin during the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) review, which could result in efforts to change rules of origin in other markets.",
            "8.",
            "Vehicle Recalls and Safety Standards",
            "Automakers must comply with strict safety standards.\n            When a defect is identified, manufacturers may face legal consequences, including class-action\n            lawsuits, regulatory fines and reputation damage due to recalls. For example, more than 100\n            million cars with Takata airbags, including around 70 million vehicles in the US, have been recalled\n            since concerns first emerged in 2007. It is the biggest safety recall in automotive history, with\n            regulatory investigations and class-action lawsuits starting to spill over across Europe.",
            "9.",
            "EV Incentives and Subsidies",
            "Legal questions surrounding government incentives for\n            EVs, such as subsidies and tax breaks, have increased. Challenges exist in navigating\n            the legal frameworks for incentives in different markets and the impact of changes in\n            policy. Without urgent policy action aimed at an easement of EV targets (e.g., perhaps\n            replacing with emissions-reduction targets and a more technology-neutral approach),\n            or the introduction of measures aimed at promoting consumers’ demand for EVs, the\n            automotive and transportation industry in Europe is at serious risk as it continues to face\n            competition from new and cheaper EVs from China. Any subsidies in Europe and the UK\n            would need to comply with applicable EU and UK subsidy control rules, while foreign\n            direct subsidies (especially to Chinese companies) affecting competition in public tenders\n            for major transportation projects in the EU are likely to attract scrutiny from the European\n            Commission under the new EU foreign subsidies regulation. In the US, there is a high\n            likelihood that EV incentives may be repealed.",
            "10.",
            "Litigation, Antitrust and Consumer Protection",
            "The rise in class-action lawsuits related\n            to defects, false advertising and misleading claims about vehicle performance (such as\n            “range anxiety” in EVs) is a growing issue. Consumer protection laws are evolving to\n            address these concerns. Access to independent repairers (particularly for high performance\n            vehicles) and meeting readily available data portability requests under the EU Data Act as\n            it enters into force in 2025 will be key issues for the legal teams of connected vehicles’\n            manufacturers and data holders. Finally, potential industry consolidation will be likely to\n            attract intense scrutiny from merger and investment control authorities.",

            "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE |Tuesday, January 14, 2025|Media Contact:[email protected]",
            "Washington, D.C.– Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced a final rule prohibiting certain transactions involving the sale or import of connected vehicles integrating specific pieces of hardware and software, or those components sold separately, with a sufficient nexus to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) or Russia.",
            "BIS and its Office of Information and Communications Technology and Services (OICTS) have found that certain technologies originating from the PRC or Russia present an undue and unacceptable risk to U.S. national security. Today’s action represents the culmination of a months-long regulatory process to design, seek public input on, and ultimately finalize a measure to protect drivers and passengers on American roads.",
            "“Cars today aren’t just steel on wheels – they're computers. They have cameras, microphones, GPS tracking, and other technologies that are connected to the internet. Through this rule, the Commerce Department is taking a necessary step to safeguard U.S. national security and protect Americans’ privacy by keeping foreign adversaries from manipulating these technologies to access sensitive or personal information,” saidU.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.“This is a targeted approach to ensure we keep PRC and Russian-manufactured technologies off American roads and protect our nation’s connected vehicle supply chains.”",
            "“Connected vehicles yield many benefits, but software and hardware sources from the PRC and other countries of concern pose grave national security risks. Today, we are taking strong action to protect Americans against these national security risks by safeguarding our critical infrastructure and automotive supply chain. President Biden has been clear: we will not hesitate to take needed action to protect the safety of the American people,”said National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.",
            "“China is trying to dominate the future of the auto industry, but connected vehicles with software and hardware systems linked to foreign adversaries could expose the American people to risks of misuse of their sensitive data or interference by malicious actors,” saidNational Economic Advisor Lael Brainard. “Today’s rule will prohibit Chinese and Russian software and hardware from being used in connected vehicles on American roads, protecting consumers and ensuring a more secure American auto industry.”",
            "“Today’s action is the final step in a comprehensive process to protect America’s connected vehicle supply chains from foreign threats. I am confident the work of OICTS, and BIS more broadly, will safeguard the U.S. automotive ecosystem and our national security now and in many years to come,” saidUnder Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan F. Estevez.",
            "“Since publishing our Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in March 2024, OICTS has engaged deeply with industry, civil society, and international partners – including through a robust public comment process – to better understand the connected vehicle supply chain,”saidOICTS Executive Director Elizabeth Cannon. “This final rule reflects significant stakeholder feedback and protects our national security while reducing unintended impacts. We look forward to working with all relevant parties to facilitate compliance as the rule comes into effect.”",
            "The final rule establishes that hardware and software integrated into the Vehicle Connectivity System (VCS) and software integrated into the Automated Driving System (ADS), the systems in vehicles that allow for external connectivity and autonomous driving capabilities, present an undue and unacceptable risk to national security when designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons with a sufficient nexus to the PRC or Russia. Malicious access to these critical supply chains could allow our foreign adversaries to extract sensitive data, including personal information about vehicle drivers or owners, and remotely manipulate vehicles.",
            "At this time, given the complexity of the commercial vehicle supply chain, the final rule applies only to passenger vehicles (defined as those under 10,001 pounds). BIS recognizes the acute national security threat presented by foreign adversary involvement in the commercial vehicle supply chain and intends to issue a separate rulemaking addressing the technologies present in connected commercial vehicles – including in trucks and buses – in the near future.",
            "Today’s final rule prohibits the import of VCS hardware or connected vehicles containing such hardware, and the import and sale of vehicles containing VCS or ADS software, with a sufficient nexus to the PRC or Russia. VCS is defined as the set of systems that allow the vehicle to communicate externally, including telematics control units, Bluetooth, cellular, satellite, and Wi-Fi modules. ADS includes the components that collectively allow a highly autonomous vehicle to operate without a driver.",
            "The rule also prohibits manufacturers with a sufficient nexus to the PRC or Russia from selling new connected vehicles that incorporate VCS hardware or software or ADS software in the United States, even if the vehicle was made in the United States.",
            "The software-related prohibitions will take effect for Model Year 2027.

            "The goal of Tesla is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.",
            "Overview of Tesla",
            "We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and offer services related to our sustainable energy products. We generally sell our products directly to customers, including through our website and retail locations. We also continue to grow our customer-facing infrastructure through a global network of vehicle service centers, Mobile Service technicians, body shops, Supercharger stations and Destination Chargers to accelerate the widespread adoption of our products. We emphasize performance, attractive styling and the safety of our users and workforce in the design and manufacture of our products, and are continuing to develop full self-driving technology for improved safety. We also strive to lower the cost of ownership for our customers through continuous efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and by offering financial services tailored to our products. Our mission to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy, our engineering expertise, vertically integrated business model and focus on user experience differentiate us from other companies.",
            "Introduction",
            "Tesla is committed to sourcing only responsibly produced materials. This means having safe and humane working conditions in our supply chain and ensuring that workers are treated with respect and dignity.In addition to the TeslaSupplier Code of Conduct(“Code”), we also have theHuman Rights and Responsible Materials policies(“Policies”) that outline our expectations to all suppliers and partners with whom we work, as well as our commitment to responsible sourcing. We strictly follow all U.S. as well as foreign legal requirements and ask our supply base to do the same. Our contractual agreements with suppliers reinforce these requirements and establish expectations of adherence to Tesla’s Code and Policies. Our suppliers are obligated to provide evidence to us of their operations that address these social, environmental and sustainability issues, as well as their sourcing in a responsible manner.",
            "Tesla’s supply chain has a unique hybrid of traditional automotive and high-tech industry suppliers from around the world. Most of our Tier 1 suppliers (i.e., directly sourced suppliers) do not purchase raw materials directly from mining/refining parties and instead obtain them",
            "fromtheirupstreamsuppliers and sub-suppliers. Therefore, reliably determining the originofall of our suppliers’productsis achallengingtask,butdue diligence practices outlined below provide additional information and transparency that helpusand our suppliers adhere to the responsible sourcing principles of our CodeandPolicies.",
            "Our Tier 1 automobile parts suppliers are required to register and complete the domestic and international material compliance requirements in the automotive industry standard International Material Data System (“IMDS”) to meet European Union and other international materials and environmental related regulations. This requirement is also mandated for all suppliers who supply their products or raw materials to us as part of our productionpart approval process.",
            "Tesla’s Responsible Supply Chain",
            "All of Tesla’s supply chain partners are subject to our Code. This Code is the foundation for ensuring social and environmental responsibility and ethical conduct throughout our supply chain, no matter the industry, region or materials. Teslacontinues to identify and do business with organizations that conduct their business with principles that are consistent with our Code.",
            "Tesla, along with our partners and independent third parties, conducts audits to observe these principles in action. If there is a reasonable basis to believe a supplier is in violation of our Code, Tesla will transition away from that relationship unless the violation is remediated in a satisfactory manner.",
            "Responsible Materials Policy",
            "The goal of Tesla’s Responsible Materials Policy is to ensure that the way our suppliers source raw materials and their derivatives is not contrary to Tesla’s mission to create a sustainable future. Tesla's suppliers are required to use reasonable efforts to ensure that their parts and products supplied to Tesla do not contribute to armed conflict, human rights abuses or environmental degradation, regardless of sourcing location. For all materials used in Tesla products, Tesla requires its suppliers to establish policies, due diligence frameworks and management systems consistent with theOECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areasor the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Tesla’s requirements are designed to accomplish the goal of only sourcing materials from suppliers who behave in accordance with our company mission.",
            "This report details our due diligence efforts to understand the origin of the conflict minerals used in our products and the company’s efforts to eliminate from our value chain any benefits our sourcing of these materials may give to armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its adjoining countries. The SEC currently defines “conflict minerals,” also known as “3TG,” as:",
            "(i)",
            "columbite-tantalite (tantalum);",
            "(ii)",
            "cassiterite (tin);",
            "(iii)",
            "gold;",

            "wolframite (tungsten); and",
            "(v)",
            "any derivatives of the above.",
            "When sourcing 3TG materials, Tesla expects suppliers to share our goal and implement steps to create a conflict-free supply chain. Where our suppliers source directly from smelters or refiners (“SoRs”), we require sourcing only from SoRs that have been validated as conflict-free by the Responsible Minerals Initiative’s (“RMI”) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (“RMAP”) or equivalent program. For our suppliers who do not source directly from an SoR, we expect them to engage with their own supply chain and require sourcing only from SoRs that are conformant to the RMAP. When we discover suppliers with non-conformant SoRs, Tesla requires these suppliers to transition to a fully conformant supply chain without delay. Suppliers may be requested to provide evidence of changes to their supply chain to prove the removal of non-conformant SoRs. Tesla recognizes the importance of mining to local communities and encourages ethical sourcing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). As recommended by the OECD, we do not support an embargo, implicit or explicit, of any DRC material, but instead allow sourcing from the region when it can be done in a responsible manner through audited value chains.",
            "In addition to conflict minerals, Tesla recognizes the potential for abuse and environmental damage in the sourcing of raw materials associated with other materials, including cobalt, nickel, lithium and mica, among others. As with 3TG suppliers, Tesla requires these suppliers to document their efforts to monitor their supply chain for any red flags indicating the use of child or forced labor or contribution to conflict or human rights abuses as well as environmental impacts in the mining or processing of these materials throughout the value chain. Suppliers must implement due diligence programs for the value chains of these materials and are expected to use the RMI’s reporting template for the collection of information where such a template is available. For all other materials, Tesla continuously assesses their sourcing for potential risks and red flags, and where any are identified, will engage with those suppliers to address any issues and require cooperation with our efforts.",
            "The sharing of sourcing information is critical to our efforts to source responsibly, and all Tesla suppliers are required to provide information upon request on their sourcing, due diligence efforts and findings for all materials included in the Responsible Materials Policy.",
            "Human Rights Policy",
            "Tesla believes the ethical treatment of all people and regard for human rights is core to our mission of a sustainable future and believes all businesses within our supply chain have a responsibility to support this mission and share our respect for human rights. Our Human Rights",
            "Policy is the formalization of our commitment to uphold and respect these rights and the values they represent. We endorse and base our definition of human rights on the United Nation's Universal Declaration for Human Rights (the“UDHR”). The UDHR focuses on dignity, respect, and equality, without discrimination, for all people. We are committed to upholding these rights and values throughout our value chain – including with respect to our employees, customers, shareholders, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. We expect that our suppliers will also support and promote these values in their own operations and in those of their own suppliers.",
            "Addressing human rights risks is an ongoing effort, involving engagement with our value chain for potential impacts, incorporating input from external stakeholders as well as reviewing and updating our own policies where necessary. With this understanding, Tesla is committed to addressing potential human rights issues both within our own operations and those of our value chain.",
            "Health and Safety",
            "Suppliers are responsible for ensuring that their employees and contractors are provided with a safe and healthy work environment. Tesla’s Supplier Code of Conduct provides guidance on Tesla’s expectations and regulatory compliance procedures for the health and safety of Tesla’s own employees. Suppliers should review our Supplier Code of Conduct to understand our minimum requirements for health and safety within their own operations.",
            "Forced Labor, Slavery and Human Trafficking",
            "Tesla is committed to ensuring that its entire value chain—from raw materials to final production—is free of any form of slave or forced labor, debt bondage or human trafficking. Tesla does not, and will not, tolerate the use of any non-voluntary, including prison, labor of any age in the manufacture of its products and does not, and will not, accept products or services from suppliers that engage in forced labor or human trafficking in any form. Human trafficking and slavery are crimes under state, federal and international law. We do not allow any direct or indirect control tactics, including corporal punishment, or the threat of corporal punishment, economic, emotional or familial abuses at our facilities, and will not allow it in the facilities of our suppliers. Tesla recognizes that these crimes exist in countries throughout the world and requires our suppliers to help in our efforts to end them regardless of geographic location or place in our value chain.",
            "Respectful Workplace and Equal Opportunities",
            "Tesla recognizes the value of different backgrounds and perspectives in our workforce, and fully promotes equal opportunity for all employees, both current and prospective. Just as we do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, national origin, disability, medical condition, military and veteran status, marital status, pregnancy or any other characteristic protected by law, regulation or ordinance, we require our suppliers to similarly respect the people in their workforces.",
            "Environmental Protection",
            "In our own operations, Tesla strives to reduce its impact to the environment by, among other efforts, using renewable energy, recycling of materials and practicing biodiversity conservation. We expect our suppliers to share our goal of recognizing environmental protection as a key principle of a sustainable future. Additional information on our expectations relating to environmental protection from our suppliers can be found in our Supplier Code of Conduct.",
            "Child Labor and Young Workers",
            "Tesla strictly follows local and national laws restricting the employment of underage workers. Regardless of local laws, no workers at a facility or location that provides materials used in Tesla products may be under the age of 15. Tesla encourages the development of potential future employees using internships or student worker programs. However, these programs should be designed for the benefit of, and include training for, the students. Participants in such programs may not perform work that is likely to endanger their health or safety, including night shifts or overtime. All participants are fairly compensated for their work based on local laws.",
            "Relationship with Communities",
            "Tesla is dedicated to being a responsible member of the communities in which we live and operate. This goes beyond our ability to create jobs and contribute to local value creation. We expect suppliers to also take every effort to continuously improve the positive aspects and reduce any negative impact of their operations on the local community, including with respect to environmental, social and other quality of life factors.",
            "Indigenous Rights",
            "The mining industry on which Tesla relies to source many raw materials that go into our products has historically had an adverse impact on the rights of indigenous peoples and communities in the areas in which they operate. For all raw material extraction and processing used in Tesla products, we expect our mining industry suppliers to engage with legitimate representatives of indigenous communities and include the right to free and informed consent in their operations.",
            "Supplier Compliance",
            "Tesla follows the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business when identifying risks within our value chain. We require suppliers to cooperate with our efforts and assist in identifying and removing practices within our value chain that are contradictory to our policies. Suppliers are required to provide requested information regarding potential violations of our policies within the value chain. Suppliers should also refer to Tesla’s Supplier Code of Conduct for details on our expectations for management systems and practices we expect our suppliers to maintain.

            "In-Scope Products",
            "As a company at the intersection of technology, transportation (electric vehicles) and energy (solar and storage), products manufactured by Tesla may contain some portion of Gold, Tantalum, Tin or Tungsten, or a combination of these.",
            "Automotive Suppliers",
            "We use the IMDS to help determine which automotive suppliers to include in our conflict minerals due diligence inquiries. Utilizing the IMDS database, we review our entire Tier 1 supplier base to determine which suppliers are likely to supply products with 3TG. To best address the use of conflict minerals within our supply chain, we engage with suppliers who have a likelihood of using the covered materials in the products supplied to us in our Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (“RCOI\"). For any automotive suppliers that provided a response in contradiction to their IMDS submission, Tesla requested that the supplier provide an update either to the IMDS or Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (“CMRT”).",
            "Non-Automotive Suppliers",
            "In an effort to include all possible sources of 3TG in our supply chains, Tesla also requests Tier 1 suppliers in our solar and energy supply chains to complete CMRTs and includes them in the RCOI with our automotive suppliers.",
            "Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry",
            "Due to Tesla’s downstream position in our supply chain, any efforts to understand the origin of raw materials rely on the cooperation of our Tier 1 and other upstream suppliers. In total, more than 650 Tier 1 suppliers took part in our RCOI process, including automotive, solar and energy suppliers. As Tesla’s supply network expands, we will continue to inform suppliers on our responsible sourcing requirements as outlined in our Code and Policies, as well as on the need to conduct due diligence efforts and share information on the sourcing of 3TG.",
            "In order to achieve our goalofa 100% response rate(percentage of Tier 1 suppliersthat provide a complete CMRT for the current reporting year), we reach outviae-mail and phoneto ourTier 1suppliers multiple times throughout the year.For this reporting year,we received responses fromover550suppliers,accumulating toa response rateofover85%-an improvementover theprevious reporting yearboth interms ofnumber of responsesas well asoverall responsepercentage.Our collection effortscaptured all business-significant suppliers and includedinformation frommore than90%of ourproductionpart spendin2021.We continue to seeexcellent participation from our automotive supply chain, witha respective response rate of92%. We will continue to work with our non-automotive suppliers, who this year had a response rate of54%.",
            "For the 2021 reporting year, we utilized the RMI’s CMRT to gather information from our Tier 1 suppliers. In order to gain greater transparency into all potential SoR and responsible minerals risks, we request suppliers to provide responses based on all of their operations at their company level rather than just providing information about their supply chain specifically related to the product(s) that Tesla purchases.",
            "In addition, Tesla engaged a reputable third-party service provider with experience in responsible sourcing of minerals data collection, to assist with the engagement and training of suppliers, collection of CMRTs, validation of responses, SoR identification and initial risk assessment.",
            "Industry Collaboration",
            "We recognize the importance of working with industry peers and organizations and believe that a consolidated effort is the most efficient method to determine the reasonable country of origin. Through our continued involvement in the RMI, we contribute information to help identify the current status of many of the SoRs in our supply chain. To help determine the reasonable country of origin for the 3TG in our supply chain, we continue to monitor and rely upon the RMI’s progress in identifying and validating SoRs.",
            "The information in Annex I is based on RMI’s RCOI data as of April 29, 2022 and Tesla’s 2021 supplier CMRT responses received. Based on this information, the countries of origin of the 3TG contained in our products may include the countries listed below in Annex I. For example, this information may be underinclusive to the extent any of our suppliers have not provided complete information regarding the countries of origin in their or their sub-suppliers' supply chains. At the same time, this list may be overinclusive due to the RMI’s database including countries from the supply chains of all of its participants and not just Tesla, and we have noted where there has been no evidence from the CMRTs collected that a country on the list is part of our supply chain. Annex II lists the conformant smelters and refiners that may be in Tesla’s or our suppliers’ supply chains with respect to 3TG contained in our products, and this information is based on the 2021 supplier CMRT responses received and data from the RMI regarding conformant SoRs.",

            "Our conflict minerals process and policies are designed to conformin all material respects with the OECD Guidance.",
            "Step 1: Establish Strong Company Management Systems",
            "As noted above, Tesla has a Human Rights and Responsible Materials Policies, as well as the Tesla Supplier Code of Conduct – all of which were updated in 2021. These policies are publicly available through our website (https://www.tesla.com/legal/additional-resources#responsible-sourcing-policies). Our supplier manuals also address our policies on responsible sourcing of minerals and state our expectation that all Tesla suppliers are accountable for performing due diligence on their mineral supply chains in accordance with OECD Guidance. Our contractual terms with suppliers (i.e., General Terms and Conditions) also include our expectation that all Tesla suppliers are accountable for performing conflict minerals due diligence aligned with OECD Guidance, as required by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.",
            "Tesla maintains a specialized team within its supply chain organization to lead these due diligence efforts, including implementing the additional use of the CMRT to further query at-risk Tier 1 suppliers. In addition, an internal cross-functional Tesla Responsible Sourcing Steering Committee (the “Steering Committee”), composed of Tesla leadership from Supply Chain, Internal Audit, EHS, Policy, ESG, Compliance and Legal, oversees these due diligence efforts and potential risks within our supply chain. Our efforts have been approved, and the letter of authorization sent to suppliers signed, by a Vice President of Tesla’s Global Supply Management.",
            "Step 2: Identify and Assess Risk in the Supply Chain",
            "Tesla’s risk identification and assessment process begins with the RCOI process detailed above and by leveraging the CMRT. In-scope Tier 1 suppliers are engaged multiple times during this process, and internal stakeholders, such as global supply managers, emphasize the importance of their participation. Supplier data is collected over a ten-week period in order to allow for follow-up and further validation.",
            "Supplier responses are continually reviewed throughout the process to ensure consistency with expected responses, and suppliers are asked to provide evidence of their own due diligence processes. Utilizing a reputable third-party, we also assess each CMRT received and follow up with suppliers who provided incomplete or invalid responses. When a supplier discloses that it has non-conformant SoRs in its supply chain, Tesla informs the supplier of our expectation to source only from suppliers that have successfully completed a responsible sourcing assessment such as the RMAP.",
            "SoR information is assessed against information provided by the RMI for validity as a SoR. Valid SoRs are then reviewed for their status as “conformant to” or “active in” a responsible sourcing audit program. Tesla also leverages the RMI’s Risk Readiness Assessment tool to better understand where potential SoR risk may emerge in our supply chain.",
            "Teslacarefully monitorsresponses fromsupplierson their own internal policies and processes regardingresponsible sourcing ofminerals.Ifa supplier’s policy does notmeet our expectations,wenot onlyemphasize the importance of these practices, butalsoworkwiththat suppliertoensure thatitspoliciesand processesare updated toappropriatelyaddress thechallengeswithintheirsupply chain.",
            "Step 3: Design and Implement a Strategy to Respond to Identified Risks",
            "We monitor SoR validation progress by the RMI or other cross-recognized SoR responsible sourcing audit programs. Any concerns with supplier responses throughout the data collection process are brought to the attention of the Steering Committee for further review and action.",
            "In alignment with OECD Guidance, Tesla shares the names of SoRs provided to us that have not been validated to the RMI for validation and audit.",
            "With recognition of the importance of cross-industry collaboration and to share best practices, Tesla continues to participate in the RMI including relevant working groups.",
            "Step 4: Perform Independent Third-Party Audit of Supply Chain Due Diligence",
            "As outlined in OECD Guidance, we support the RMI, an industry initiative which audits due diligence activities of SoRs. We support the RMI’s outreach efforts and RMAP SoR audits through our membership and participation in working groups. We reserve the right to ask any high-risk Tier 1 supplier to audit their supply chain conflict minerals due diligence program using a third-party independent auditor.",
            "The data on which we rely for certain statements in this declaration are obtained through our membership in the RMI using the RCOI report for RMI member ID: TSLA.",
            "Step 5: Report on Supply Chain Due Diligence",
            "We report on our due diligence efforts as required by law and to comply with Rule 13p-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.This report is also available on Tesla’s publicly available Legal page (www.tesla.com/about/legal). We also report on our efforts within the annual Tesla Impact Report.",
            "Continuous Improvement",

These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations. Various important factors could cause actual results to differ materially, including the risks identified in our SEC filings. Tesla disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this report.",
            "Results of Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry & Due Diligence",
            "Annex I",
            "Due to Tesla’s downstream position in our supply chain, any efforts to understand the origin of raw materials rely heavily on the cooperation of our Tier 1 and upstream suppliers.Because many of our Tier 1 suppliers submitted company level reporting templates, we are unable to reliably confirm whether several non-conformant 3TG facilities are active in our supply chain; we continue to engage with our suppliers to improve due diligence efforts and transparency to be able to further address any potential risks or non-conformances. Based on our due diligence efforts to date, we believe that the following list of countries of origin reflects countries from which our suppliers may have sourced from conformant SoRs and refiners.This information may be underinclusive to the extent any of our suppliers have not provided complete information regarding the countries of origin in their or their sub-suppliers' supply chains. At the same time, this list may be overinclusive due to the RMI’s database including countries from the supply chains of all of its participants and not just Tesla, and we have noted where there has been no evidence from the CMRTs collected that a country on the list is part of our supply chainTesla will continue to work with our suppliers to encourage sourcing only from conformant SoRs, including by encouraging suppliers to have their non-participating SoRs successfully participate in an audit program.",
            "All materials sourced through conformant SoRs are considered responsible sources of 3TG materials.Tesla continues to work to gain further insight and transparency into our and our suppliers’ supply chains for 3TG, including fully identifying countries of origin of 3TG and the SoRs used to process the necessary conflict minerals in Tesla’s products.",
            "The majority of our suppliers provided information on the SoRs used in their entire operations at the company level, and not just for their products specifically purchased by Tesla. It is important to note we do not have direct relationships with sub-suppliers or smelters in many of these countries and our influence on the supply chain when it is several tiers removed is limited. Therefore, although a country may be listed in the tables below, it does not necessarily indicate that Tesla or one of our suppliers is sourcing from that country.As our processes continue to improve and the specificity of the RCOI information increases, this list may fluctuate year over year.",

Identification was performed by both Tesla’s engaged third-party service provider as well as an internal review of SoR names as compared to the RMI’s SoR database.

The facility locations are listed as they appear on the RMI Smelter Database.The majority of our suppliers provided company level information, not Tesla-specific information. As a result, inclusion in this list is not necessarily an indication that any particular facility supplies materials that are ultimately incorporated into Tesla products. We publish this list to promote supply chain transparency, hold ourselves and our suppliers accountable to progressive, continuous improvement of responsible sourcing practices, encourage continued SoR participation in RMAP, and encourage SoRs that are not yet participating in a responsible sourcing program to accelerate their efforts to demonstrate responsible mineral procurement practices.",

        "title": "Tesla: How Machines Are Now Driving Our Cars - Technology and Operations Management",
        "paragraphs": [
            "Autonomous cars are starting to show up on our roads – Google, Uber, Lyft, Tesla, and many of the traditional automotive OEMs have started testing and releasing early-phase autonomous cars. This trend of autonomous driving will continue and will spur massive changes to our transportation networks, cities, and societies.",
            "Self-driving cars function by having an array of radar and ultrasonic sensors capture vast amounts of data about its operating environment to process in real-time and send control instructions to the steering system of the vehicle. Current Tesla vehicles blend together a variety of sensors including cameras, radar, and ultrasonics (Figure 1) to monitor their surroundings. The heart of this functionality lies in the applied machine learning algorithms that take in disparate data sets and output driving commands that allow the car to follow the road and adhere to its laws.",
            "Figure 1: Source: Image fromTesla Autopilot Websitehttps://www.tesla.com/autopilot",
            "The data processing referenced above can be split into two parts: 1) the on-machine portion 2)the cloud.",
            "On-machine refers to the processing that happens in real-time on the car in order make the control decisions. As was mentioned above, the images from the cameras and radar are combined to allow the car to understand its environmental constraints and produce a set of outputs to control the speed, acceleration, and direction of the vehicle.",
            "Separately, Tesla unleashes the power of machine learning in the cloud2. The machine learning network is a massive neural network project that takes data from all Tesla vehicles and uploads them to the cloud for processing. The hundreds of sensors on each car will capture driving data that can then be fed into the machine learning algorithms which operate in data centers around the world. These algorithms learn from the success and failures of each individual car to continuously refine how the onboard computers respond to data inputs.",
            "Machine learning has enormous implications for Tesla. Having the greatest number of vehicles on the road with Autopilot systems allows them to capture far more information than their competitors. In a report by McKinsey & Co1, the automotive big data business could be worth $750 billion by 2030 and Tesla by virtue of being a first-mover in this space could be well positioned to capture a vast portion of that market.",
            "The Society of Automotive Engineers publishes a model of autonomous driving that shows the level of attention required from the driver (Figure 2). Tesla vehicles currently offer Level 2 autonomous driving which still requires attention from the driver. However, Tesla is on the verge of releasing Version 9 of its Autopilot program this year, which will usher in the era of Level 3 autonomous driving for the masses – still requiring drivers to be present, however, not requiring drivers to actively monitor the environment.",
            "Figure 2: Source: Image fromNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Websitehttps://www.nhtsa.gov/technology-innovation/automated-vehicles-safety",
            "In the near term, Tesla will need to deliver on their plan to reach Level 5 Full Autonomous driving and they will do so by taking their learnings from their massive neural network and feeding that right back into the developmental process. In the long term, Tesla will need to work with governments, infrastructure development firms, and the rest of the automotive industry to build out smart infrastructure that will allow further networked communications to keep cars safe on the road and reduce the level of congestion in cities.",
            "While Tesla has a strong lead in the number of vehicles on the road, which allows them to collect large amounts of data, they will need to be aware of the limitations of the technology. Many have accused the company of being deceptive with their marketing, leading to deaths of drivers that believed their cars were fully autonomous. This is a challenge that Tesla needs to work on as safety should be their number one concern.",
            "The Trolley Problem3is a common thought experiment in ethics that applies directly to machine learning: You see a runaway trolley moving towards a group of five people, while a lone person stands off to the side. You have the option to pull a lever to redirect the trolley to the lone person and save the lives of the five people that it’s currently aimed at. What do you do? This is the exact type of question that a machine learning algorithm will have to solve. If you were put in this situation, what would you do? (752 words)",

            "Very well-written article. This is a very controversial topic and the way you finish the article – with the question directed to a human on what he/she would do – goes direct to the point I would like to bring. I can relate this to the situation of being robbed and asked not to react. The reality is that you simply don’t know how you are going to react until that happens to you (and even in this case I believe that there might be many factors around you that might make you react differently in similar situations), and so how are you going to program a machine for knowing that? What is right or wrong? And how are you going to impose that decision for everyone else?  I actually see the autonomous car as an opportunity to improve safety (reduce drinking & driving, avoid accidents cause for humans’ deviations such as falling asleep or getting distracted, etc) and an opportunity for us to better control the outcome of situations. While in real human interactions you can’t really predict reactions, here you have an opportunity to program and control it. But, do we want big automobile companies deciding on what is right or wrong and taking out our individual critical sense? Who is going to determine that the life of that single person matters less than the others’ lives? And how will the machine react when faced with non-programmed situations?  Big question marks arise when we are faced with a big revolution (i.e. cloning and the commodification of live) and this just prove that we stand before one right now.",
            "I found this extremely interesting as it’s something that is frequently discussed when we talk about the next wave of technology.  I never had a good understanding of how autonomous vehicles would work, but after learning about machine learning and reading through this article, it makes sense.  The dependency on the cloud, where Tesla is constantly collecting data from all of its driverless cars, correcting for error and enforcing success, is what seemingly driving the tech forward.  With most applications of machine learning, there is this virtuous cycle, where you get more and more cars on the road, get more data, those cars learn and drive more effectively, and thus demand for autonomous vehicles goes up.  The Trolley Problem is a tough one, but I think this is where we can actually see a benefit of autonomous vehicles (albeit a cold-blooded benefit perhaps) – humans might not be able to make the rational decision, but these cars will.",
            "Such a fascinating read! The neural network project for continuous refinement of the onboard computers is especially critical; the quality of these computers has a direct and very, very real impact on the safety of the passengers. I think, for many people, the tech behind autonomous cars is beyond their comfort zone. But I wonder, with those same people deeply concerned about the safety of these vehicles, should Tesla make an effort to communicate the sophistication of their technology and data processing and, if so, how? Do they have a responsibility to make this knowledge public and accessible, so as to ease concerns and fuel buy-in in the movement towards autonomous vehicles? Would it be a benefit or waste of their time?I’m also very interested in the ethics of this problem – some individuals think that Tesla, and similar companies employing ML systems, have a responsibility to hire Ethics Officers/Employees to oversee the salient moral implications of automating human decisions. At the same time, although there have been serious accidents, have we not already seen a massive improvement in the quality of driving among these autonomous vehicles, which would lead to a major reduction in motor-vehicle accidents? Is this also a matter of educating the public? Do we even need their understanding if this is a trend that will move forward regardless?",

        "paragraphs": [
            "Harvard Law expert says that Elon Musk and the tech industry risk gains when they engage in disreputable business practices",
            "Testifying recently at his trial for tweeting in 2018 that he had secured funding to take the electric car company Tesla private, Elon Musk suggested that people shouldn’t believe everything that he writes on the social network he now owns, telling the court that, “Just because I tweet something does not mean people believe it or will act accordingly.” Having already been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the famous billionaire entrepreneur who also oversees SpaceX was being sued by shareholders who claim they lost billions when Tesla’s stock initially rose, then suddenly dropped when a deal failed to materialize. Although the jury ultimately did not impose liability on Musk for the tweet, questions about his business practices remain.",
            "According to business ethics expertJ.S. Nelson ’01, Musk’s trial is just the latest example of how he has drawn attention for violating much of the “social contract with employees, investors, suppliers, regulators, and other parts of his ecosystem.” To learn more, Harvard Law Today recently spoke with Nelson, currently a visiting researcher at Harvard Law’s Program on Negotiation and a professor at Villanova University’s Charles Widger School of Law. She is the author, with the late Lynn Stout, of the 2022 book, “Business Ethics: What Everyone Needs to Know.” Nelson argues that Musk is beginning to pay the price in other ways for questionable business practices that have eroded trust, and she advises that, while unethical conduct can bring short-term gains, running an ethical business “pays better over the long term in dividends that are sustainable.”",
            "Harvard Law Today: What are business ethics and why do they matter?",
            "J.S. Nelson:Business ethics are how we behave in the business context, and the impacts that our behavior have on the business world around us. Behaving ethically is important to our lives, to our well-being, to society, and to how we make money. It’s not true that making money in any way, shape, or form is good. Adam Smith recognized that, for capitalism to make a society prosperous, exchanges of goods and services need to make both parties better off. If I promise to give you something in exchange for shoes, and you give me the shoes, and I run away with them — if I violate the terms of that exchange so that we’re no longer both gaining from the exchange — we don’t have a socially beneficial exchange. We’re talking about maintaining the core of how our market system works. In addition, there are massive benefits to businesses and people who behave ethically, and significant penalties in the long term against people who do not.",
            "“[T]here are massive benefits to businesses and people who behave ethically, and significant penalties in the long term against people who do not.”",
            "HLT: Is Elon Musk reaping those ethical benefits?",
            "Nelson:No, Elon Musk has violated a lot of the social contract, and its basis of trust, with employees, with investors, suppliers, regulators, and other parts of his ecosystem. He is starting to feel the repercussions of having destroyed the ethical assumptions that underlie many of those relationships.",
            "The Latin word for “trust,” for example, is the basis of our word for credit. If you do not trust someone, you do not extend credit to them on the same terms. Elon Musk is trying to renegotiate $3 billion of the high-interest-rate loans that he took out to buy Twitter. Can you imagine what terms he’s going to be offered now? Would you trust him after he’s tried to back out of that very contract? In addition, because of Musk’s actions, an estimated 83% of Twitter’s workforce has left, and the company is being sued for non-payment of rent in multiple jurisdictions. Would you be eager to work for him at a discount, or to rent office space to him for less than at a very high premium?",
            "Musk’s approach at Twitter has had terrible consequences for the company. From when he took over four months ago, merely 17% of Twitter’s workforce is still available. The company has lost 40% of its revenue, with advertisers jumping ship constantly. There is the very real possibility that it may have to file for bankruptcy soon.",
            "The trust deficit that Musk’s behavior fosters spreads across his different ventures. Part of his defense in the Tesla trial was even to tell us that we shouldn’t trust him. Musk has now broken a record for personally losing the most money of anyone in history — $182 billion since November of 2021. He doesn’t seem like a star you’d hitch your wagon to.",
            "By contrast, companies with a good ethical reputation can more easily hire employees, and they do so on better terms. Surveys show that, even during difficult economic times, 92% of employees would leave their current job to work for an employer with an excellent ethical reputation. There’s only so much high-caliber tech talent out there, and those people will have options, even amid layoffs. When Musk is hiring again, they will remember that he has a reputation for not treating his workforce well. Employees will be less likely to accept jobs at his companies, and more likely to demand monetary premiums to accept those jobs. Historically, employees are 77% less likely to take a job with an unethical company, and an unethical company has to offer employees a 57% pay premium for them to consider taking it.",
            "“Surveys show that, even during difficult economic times, 92% of employees would leave their current job to work for an employer with an excellent ethical reputation.”",
            "HLT: Is the amount of criticism that Elon Musk and his companies receive relative to others a form of observation bias because they’re simply in the limelight more often?",
            "Nelson:I don’t think so. There are at least two reasons why this story and sector have gripped our attention. The first is that what’s going on at Tesla and Twitter, as two examples of Musk’s companies, is not the way that people at other companies are necessarily behaving or at the magnitude that other people are doing similar things. Elon Musk has already been fined over $20 million by the SEC for things that he’s tweeted and said to investors.",
            "But there’s also something to be said about why we are hearing so much about unrest in the tech sector generally. Even ahead of the rest of the economy, that sector is going through massive layoffs, which are happening because its management seems so little committed to employees. The layoffs stand in stark contrast to these companies’ recent profits. Jeff Bezos of Amazon, for example, could give roughly $110,000 to every person who works for Amazon around the world, and still retain more money than he had before the pandemic. The profits that these companies have made, especially over the last two or three years, are astonishing. But workers have not felt appreciated for contributing to company profits. Instead, there are many stories about the brutal experience of working in an Amazon warehouse and elsewhere, with employees under constant pressure to meet unrealistic performance goals, often getting injured, and ultimately feeling like robots.",
            "HLT: How does the tech industry ethos of ‘move fast and break things’ impact the way that CEOs think about business ethics?",
            "Nelson:There are a lot of innovative companies that don’t move fast and break things through not treating their employees well. You don’t want to break your people.",
            "If you make the terms of employment very mercenary, you receive mercenary behavior back. A reputation for bad ethics costs companies not only in salary, but in innovation, productivity, and turnover.",
            "Treating your people as disposable is leading to the spread of “quiet-quitting,” and other such disengaged phenomena. Only about a third of U.S. employees still report that they are actively engaged with their work — with not many differences between remote and non-remote workers.",
            "But treating people well matters, and good management increases employee engagement. Employees need to believe that the company will treat them well, and that they want to invest personally in its success. Engaged and motived employees spur innovation. Well-managed companies see that investment in their profitability numbers. Organizations with happy and engaged workers tend to be 22% more productive than organizations with lower satisfaction rates and less employee commitment.",
            "“Treating your people as disposable is leading to the spread of “quiet-quitting,” and other such disengaged phenomena.”",
            "HLT: What is the bigger impact of the ways Elon Musk and perhaps some other tech CEOs lead?",
            "Nelson:Elon Musk is a product of the system that we have created. He has been rewarded in the short term for a lot of really bad behavior, which would have greater repercussions for anybody else. That distortion sends a signal to other people to behave the way that he has. But too many people behaving that way destabilizes our system.",
            "We now realize that a purely transactional approach toward your people is dangerous for any business. Mercenary behavior and unethical conduct tend to cluster together. Ethical misconduct spreads and results in pervasive wrongdoing across organizations. Without an ethical environment, you can’t manage a company because you can trust your people to tell you the truth, and to give you the information that you need to run your organization. Poor management can also create misconduct through pushing people too hard. My research on managerial misuse of workplace surveillance systems shows what a threat, for example, they can be to business ethics and basic compliance.",
            "It’s dangerous for us and for investors to trust companies that behave unethically. Not so long ago in the 2007–2008 financial crisis, we lost 45% of the world’s wealth through mortgage fraud, among other things. These bubbles have consequences. Lies and displays of callous behavior have consequences. We, as a society, should be smarter about not allowing unethical excesses and the damage that it causes. We should even more consciously reward behavior that is more profitable for all of us in the long term.",
            "“Elon Musk is a product of the system that we have created. He has been rewarded in the short term for a lot of really bad behavior, which would have greater repercussions for anybody else.”",
            "HLT: Last question. Is the system up to it? In the recent suit brought by shareholders, Elon Musk was not found liable. And so, while he’s paid lots of fines, it is hard not to wonder if the system is strong enough to get to the place you’re talking about, where we’re not rewarding the bad behavior, and we are rewarding good behavior? And if not, what needs to change?",
            "Nelson:Engaging in business ethics and its benefits for our society cannot simply be a matter of law-enforcement cases or civil suits at the end of the line. By then, most of the damage has been done. At that point, you’re picking over the bodies, and trying to figure out how to compensate people as best you can for the harm that they allege they have already incurred. It’s particularly perverse for someone like Musk who lies to be able to say that he should escape liability because he lies so much. We need our culture and institutions to focus on encouraging and rewarding ethical behavior for market transactions to be mutually beneficial.",
            "And we do see that. There is a positive story here. The data show that you shouldn’t be a jerk to get ahead. We, as human beings, tend to reward pro-social behavior over the long term, and in normal conditions, we shun those who engage in behavior that is damaging to the rest of us. Being ethical pays, and it pays better over the long term in dividends that are sustainable. It may be less flashy, but you’re more likely to live a good life, to provide for the people around you, to build something that you are proud of, including a company that is solid, that contributes the goods and services that people need, and that adds value.",
            "It was Adam Smith’s great insight that the ethically bargained-for exchange would make both parties better off. An ethical exchange grows the pie for everyone. So, let’s get back to that. Let’s get back to Adam Smith and preserve the good things that capitalism can do when we keep healthy the core of business ethics upon which it depends.",
