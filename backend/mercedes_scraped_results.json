        "title": "Germany’s car industry crisis - this is what may fix it",
        "paragraphs": [
            "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
            "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
            "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
            "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus – a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
            "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
            "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
            "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy – and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
            "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly – and supports millions of other jobs.",
            "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
            "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
            "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
            "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Shütz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
            "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
            "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 – in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US – the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
            "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
            "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold – 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example – their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
            "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
            "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly – that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Schütz.",
            "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
            "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
            "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about €5,300, compared with €4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
            "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged €62 per hour, compared to €29 in Spain and €20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
            "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
            "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China – much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Schütz.",
            "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
            "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
            "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
            "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers – and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
            "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
            "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
            "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself – and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
            "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
            "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
            "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
            "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
            "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
            "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
            "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  – in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
            "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
            "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
            "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
            "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
            "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
            "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Schütz.",
            "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
            "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
            "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
            "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
            "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
            "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
            "Simon Schütz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
            "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
            "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
            "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
            "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
            "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

        "title": "Merz won the German election. Here’s what it means for Europe. – POLITICO",
        "paragraphs": [
            "BRUSSELS ― Conservative leader Friedrich Merz won the German election Sunday and is on track to take the reins of the EU’s largest economy.",
            "It’s not yet clear exactly what the new German government will look like — or how far Merz will be able to reshape German politics as he sees fit. It’s likely to be weeks before coalition talks between Merz’s Christian Democratic alliance (CDU/CSU) and other parties reach an agreement and Merz becomes chancellor.",
            "Still, one thing looks certain: Merz will take Germany in a different direction from that of current Chancellor Olaf Scholz. It may not even look like the Germany that Angela Merkel, also of the CDU, led for 16 years, until 2021.",
            "Note: Without rounding, BSW’s result stands at 4.972 percent; Source: Bundeswahlleiterin",
            "Last month, Merz (unsuccessfully) pushed the German parliament for new migration measures with the support of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. It marked a clear departure from Merkel’s “Wir schaffen das” pledge to take in refugees.",
            "And there’s more. From a potential U-turn in Germany’s long-standing policy on nuclear energy and a more hawkish line on China, to plans to reboot the German-French axis to bolster EU trade, Merz could shake up the political landscape of Germany and, in one fell swoop, that of the European Union as a whole.",
            "Here’s what a Merz-led Germany means for the EU.",
            "Two days before the election, Merz issued a stark warning that Europe must be prepared to defend itself without the U.S. “We must prepare for the possibility that Donald Trump will no longer uphold NATO’s mutual defense commitment unconditionally,” Merz said in an interview with a German broadcaster, signaling that Germany may seek nuclear protection from European allies.",
            "“We need to have discussions with both the British and the French — the two European nuclear powers — about whether nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security from the U.K. and France, could also apply to us,” he said.",
            "Elsewhere, Merz has promised big and broad policies to scale up Germany’s defense industry, and will be expected to follow through quickly on an earlier pledge toscrap his predecessor’s blockon the dispatch of long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine for strikes on Russian targets.",
            "A major theme of his early weeks in the chancellery will be setting out how Berlin plans to raise the cash to expand on the €100 billion fund agreed under the Scholz government to finance an upgrade of the Bundeswehr’s gear and digs.",
            "That cash pot has been allocated and will be spent up by 2027 on massive procurement programs, raising questions over how Berlin plans to meet its obligations to NATO — which Merz has promised to do in the future — from the conventional national budget.",
            "“The 2 percent target may be pushed up again and then we will have to prepare ourselves for that,” Merz toldPOLITICO’s Berlin Playbook podcastof plans to further raise the NATO target given Trump has called for a 5 percent target.",
            "Over the past few years, German energy policy has focused on turbocharging investment in renewable energy, shutting down nuclear reactors and scrambling to secure gas supplies from abroad to replace Russian imports.",
            "Merz’s CDU has similarly vowed to “consistently use renewable energies, all of them.” But his political family, the center-right European People’s Party, is also pushing back against EU green energy targets.",
            "Meanwhile, Merz has taken a warmer tone toward nuclear energy than Scholz, which is challenging a long-standing German taboo around atomic power. While the country is unlikely to revive its shuttered reactors, a more lenient nuclear stance from Berlin could help pro-atomic countries persuade Brussels to treat atomic power more like renewables.",
            "Merz has also said he wants to repeal Germany’s hard-fought Building Energy Law, which aims to accelerate a clean heating rollout — offering a potential signal to green skeptics in Europe.",
            "A Merz-led government will place less emphasis on climate change than Scholz’s coalition. Merz expressed concern on the campaign trail about the impact of climate policy on business, vowed to put economic growth above all other concerns and led a call to roll back several EU green regulations.",
            "But green advocates express confidence that in government Merz’s rhetorical hammer will turn feather duster. Industry, broadly, wants less bureaucracy, but it also wants consistent policy. Industrial stimulus can be used to help companies become greener and more efficient. “That they will not do it in the name of climate policy. Fine. If it’s economic policy for them. Fine,” said Linda Kalcher, executive director of the Strategic Perspectives think tank.",
            "Merz, like Scholz, wants to delay key corporate sustainability reporting rules to boost Germany’s ailing industry.",
            "That means it’s pretty much assured that Germany under Merz would back astrong omnibus simplification billfor green rules, a proposal the European Commission is expected to release on Feb. 26.",
            "A Merz victory also means the center-right European People’s Party, which dominates the European Parliament and is Merz’s political family, once again has a powerful ally in the EU’s biggest economy. Already, the EPP has pushed hard to water down the EU anti-deforestation rulewith the supportof groups further to the right (mostly without success thus far).",
            "Merz is inheriting an economy in recession that is being further dragged down by a crisis engulfing its automotive sector. He recognizes the problems: high energy and labor costs, and stiff competition in the electric vehicle transition. But he’s been light on the details of how he intends to help automakers.",
            "In campaign speeches, he promised to cut red tape and reduce high costs but stopped short of putting support behind reforming Germany’s debt brake, which will keep Merz’s hands tied when it comes to funding such initiatives.",
            "Germany’s carmakers are highly dependent on the Chinese market, which led Scholz to acquiesce to Beijing’s wishes, such as lobbying against the made-in-China EV duties. Merz will take a harder line with China and has made clear to automakers that they should not come crawling to him if their Asian investments blow up.",
            "Taking a stronger line on Russia and China and rekindling old friendships with fellow EU leaders: Merz has his work cut out for him if he wants to link the German export economy to global growth hot spots like the Mercosur countries, Mexico or Southeast Asia.",
            "Merz recognizes that a functional Franco-German axis can create more trade deals, more certainty for companies and — eventually — a stronger Europe. “We have to overcome our dispute on Mercosur,” Merztold the World Economic Forumin Davos last month, saying he was in regular close contact with French President Emmanuel Macron.",
            "The Christian Democrat has also signaled a harder approach to China. Or, at least, he’s admitted the German economy is too dependent on Beijing’s woes and wishes. But just how hawkish Merz’s approach to trade will end up being is likely to be determined by who he ends up with as a coalition partner.",
            "A victory for Merz’s CDU means Berlin will align on agricultural policy with both the largest political bloc in the European Parliament — the European People’s Party led by Bavarian Manfred Weber — and EU Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen.",
            "Ahead of negotiations over the future of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy, Hansen has launched anoverhaul of farm policythat would effectively roll back the green agenda of the last term and instead emphasize making farming a more attractive and economically viable occupation. In its campaign platform, Merz’s CDU said it wants a CAP “that serves farmers.”",
            "Scholz’s center-left government pushed initiatives to support organic farming and reduce food waste. But it clashed with farmers a year ago over its decision to scrap tax breaks on agricultural diesel. The CDU said it will reinstate the diesel tax break and take broader action to strengthen planning security for farmers. “With the CDU, no farmer will have to protest with his tractor in front of the Brandenburg Gate anymore,” the party said.",
            "Merz’s chancellorship will mark the return of conservative opposition to meddling with Germany’s notorious debt brake, which limits government deficit spending to 0.35 percent a year and is seen by many as the cause of the shoddy state of the country’s infrastructure.",
            "Scholz’s efforts to tamper with the brake caused the collapse of his government, and Merz’s CDU faction is fiercely opposed to any reform — up to a point. Surprisingly enough, Merz himself, during aTV debateearlier this month, intimated openness to some fine-tuning, but not before other solutions are tried. Timid, yes, but revolutionary from a Christian Democrat.",
            "Otherwise, financial markets are broadly skeptical that Merz can do much to stall Germany’s well-documented economic decline, with gross domestic product expected to contract 0.5 percent in 2025. During the race, the choice between the two parties’ economic policies was ultimately “superficial,” ING Global Head of Macro Carsten Brzeski lamented in a note earlier this month, noting that Merz’s plans for tax and spending cuts reflected an almost spiritual faith in free markets — the very same markets that have dealt such a humiliating blow to Germany’s economic prestige.",
            "Merz will also have critical sway over the outcome of a major transnational banking battle that could put EU ideals to the test. When Milanese lender UniCredit made its surprise bid on Germany’s Commerzbank last year, it looked like exactly the kind of cross-border banking consolidation that Mario Draghi was advocating in his landmark report — until Scholz’s government reacted with horror anddreamed up wild schemesto block it. UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel has since said he will wait on Merz’s position before making another move, but it’s hard to imagine the new leader will be any more keen to give away one of the country’s most prized lenders.",
            "Merz holds the keys to significantly boosting Europe’s defense capabilities in the years to come. As Trump pressures Europe to pony up military spending, many in Brussels are anxiously waiting for Germany to give its blessing for the European Commission to borrow money on behalf of member countries. Highly indebted countries such as France, Italy and Spain who fall short of NATO’s defense spending target argue that receiving “free money” from Brussels is the only way for them to drastically increase military spending without making politically unpopular cuts to other budget areas.",
            "Merz warmed to this idea during the election campaign — and supporters hope that his backing will defeat opposition from frugal allies such as Austria and the Netherlands. There are many less controversial ideas on the table, such as exempting defense from EU spending rules or increasing military funds in the EU’s new multiyear budget that will come into force in 2028. But supporters of common debt argue that none of these will be enough to meet the scale of the challenge alone.",
            "Germany’s industrial giants are flailing and shedding jobs. Merz will be expected to act. His party’s manifesto called for “Made in Germany” champions and for a modern antitrust and competition law “that uses a global market as a benchmark,”  references to the Siemens-Alstom deal to create a European rail champion that was blocked by the EU.",
            "Merz is also a fan of cross-border state-funded projects, known as Important Projects of Common European Interest, saying he wants to use such instruments “as effectively as possible in Germany.” The country has been one of the driving forces of several IPCEIs, which have led to the public financing of hydrogen, batteries and cloud infrastructure.",
            "He also wants Germany’s national rail company Deutsche Bahn to be streamlined and restructured, with infrastructure and transport separated “to increase competition.” Given the dire state of German rail, this could prove to be a popular move.",
            "Merz sees digital transformation as the key to Germany’s industrial revival and wants to turn the country into Europe’s tech front-runner. His plan is to earmark 3.5 percent of gross domestic product to research and development by 2030, with a special focus on space, quantum computing, artificial intelligence and cloud technologies.",
            "Key proposals include setting up a standalone digital ministry (currently merged with transport) and offering new startups temporary relief from red tape.Merz has alsosaidthat bureaucracy in Berlin and Brussels needs to be drastically reduced for Germany to regain its competitive edge. This stance is in line with the center-right views in EU institutions, where a major push to simplify digital rules is underway.",
            "In the months leading up to the German election,Berlin’s lawmakers looked to toughen up restrictions on (and potentially ban) high-risk vendors — cough, Chinese suppliers like Huawei — to implement the EU’sruleson cybersecurity in critical sectors.",
            "With work on the draft law rolling over, Merz will be faced with a decision on whether to crack down on Chinese tech in Germany’s critical sectors. His CDU party said that it wants to maintain close economic relations with China, but also committed to taking steps to protect critical infrastructure and security relevant technology.",
            "The party manifesto also outlined a sweeping change of course in terms of data protection policy, encouraging more “pragmatic” rules that allow data to be used for innovation and growth, as well as law enforcement.",
            "A Merz win signals a blow for Germany’s cannabis users, after the CDU leader pledged to reverse last year’s partial decriminalization of the drug. He blames the new policies, which allow adults to possess up to 25 grams of cannabis in public and grow three plants per household, for an increase in drug-related crime.",
            "It could be good news for fans of the EU’s new rules to digitalize European health records, the European Health Data Space.In an attempt to force notoriously analog Germans away from paper files, Merz hassuggestedthat anyone who stores their data in an electronic patient file could receive a discount on health insurance contributions.",

            "AtEssayPandas, we can help you complete different MBA assessment projects and theoretical frameworks like PESTEL/PEST/STEP analysis of different companies. For instance, Mercedes-Benz' PESTEL analysis will mainly focus on the external Macro-Environmental factors such as Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal, that can directly affect Mercedes-Benz.",
            "A detailed PESTEL Analysis can help managers explore three inter-related environments, i.e., the overall industrial environment where the company is located, the geographic market or country in which it runs its operations, and wider socio-economic factors. Below is a demonstration of how this PESTEL analysis can be written step by step.Ask usfor custom PESTEL Analysishelpif you still find it difficult.",
            "PESTEL is an acronym for Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal Analysis. This environment scanning tool is mainly used to understand the external macro-economic influences on the industry, a particular sector, business, and its product/service offerings. These environmental forces are considered external as they cannot be controlled by a firm. However, an in-depth PESTEL analysis of Mercedes-Benz can enhance the companies’ readiness to handle external environmental turbulence. It is one of the most widely used strategic planning and management tools that help management in assessing the impact of different environmental factors on the business and identifying the threats and opportunities that reside in the external environment. By gaining an in-depth understanding of the external environment, management can make wise strategic decisions according to the underlying context.",
            "PESTEL analysis is a simple and easy to apply environment scanning framework that facilitates the understanding of the broader business environment. It encourages organizational management to think strategically, and quickly respond to the external environment changes to avoid or reduce the negative impact on business operations. It also encourages the management to analyze the external business environment from different possible dimensions. However, conducting a detailed PESTEL analysis involves extensive time, and the model cannot offer a full picture of the environmental complexity. Moreover, the model does not clearly highlight the complex inter-connectedness between different external environmental forces. Despite these limitations, the model is still extensively employed to make important business decisions. Model is found to be particularly helpful when firms need to make international expansion decisions. The effectiveness of this model increases when it is combined with other strategic planning tools.",
            "‘Political factors’ are the first component of the PESTEL framework that exert a strong impact on the business, and play an important role in determining the business’ long-term sustainability. Some examples of political factors are taxation policies and trade regulations that governments can levy around the year and it may influence the overall business environment. A strong presence at the international stage increases the vulnerability of Mercedes-Benz  to a variety of political, structural, and systematic risks. To ensure long-term survival, Mercedes-Benz  should consider the following political factors to enhance the readiness to changing political environment dynamics:",
            "Political stability is important for business organizations as it influences customer and investor confidence, and therefore, has a wide impact on the economy. High political instability has serious implications for the consumption, investment, and economic growth of businesses. Currently, the geographic area in which Mercedes-Benz  is actively present is experiencing some political instability due to internal and external conflicts. Inability to understand and handle the prevailing political chaos can inhibit the company from achieving its growth objectives, and management will be reluctant to invest in new capital.",
            "Uncertainty in the political environment refers to the frequency of changes in government policies and regulations. Frequent policy changes affect business performance and make decision-making more challenging due to prevailing uncertainty. Mercedes-Benz  should actively scan the political environment to ensure quick adaptation with changing policies and reset the strategic priorities accordingly.",
            "The current governance system is based on democracy, which makes the business environment friendly for Mercedes-Benz . Mercedes-Benz  can benefit from the economic freedom offered by the democratic governance system, which promotes entrepreneurship and free trade.",
            "Pressure groups can affect the business environment by finding strong allies in the media. These groups pressurize the organizations by arranging protests and running marketing campaigns. Mercedes-Benz  needs to keep an eye on the activities of these pressure groups as they can influence the government’s policies, which may ultimately affect the overall business environment. Mercedes-Benz  should closely collaborate with these groups to win their trust and should invest in ethical and social activities to develop closer ties with society.",
            "A transparent governance structure is crucial for promoting a friendly business environment. Mercedes-Benz  is currently facing several issues due to corruption and lack of transparency. This lack of transparency is mainly linked with the prevailing political uncertainty and instability. Due to corruption, fraudulent activities are on the rise, business activities like licensing and contracting have become more challenging, and law enforcement has weakened, which is hampering the stakeholders’ trust in the business entities and government institutions. Overall, rising bureaucratic corruption is halting economic growth, resulting in reduced growth opportunities for business organizations like Mercedes-Benz.",
            "While making the expansion decisions, Mercedes-Benz  should carefully review the industry-specific taxation policies. . The taxation policies will be more favourable for industries that are on top government priorities. Currently, governments in many developing countries are interested in reducing corporate taxes in an attempt to attract foreign direct investment. Mercedes-Benz  should consider these countries, as it will be easier to make profits and invest in the innovation, new product and research and development activities due to low tax rate.",
            "The business expansion decision of Mercedes-Benz  should also consider the prevailing trade regulations, and management should prefer the regions with free or flexible trade agreements. The region under consideration is currently reducing the trade restrictions to ease the environment for foreign business players, which increases the attractiveness of this region for Mercedes-Benz , which is seeking international business growth opportunities.",
            "Economic factors- the second component of PESTEL framework, comprise multifaceted variables that directly affect the businesses’ ability to achieve their economic objectives. Mercedes-Benz  must gain an in-depth understanding of these factors to anticipate the short-term and long-term business growth in the chosen sector.  Some of the key economic factors are explained below:",
            "High financial market efficiency shares a strong positive relationship with overall economic growth, making capital accumulation and goods/service production easier. Therefore, Mercedes-Benz needs to choose the countries with highly efficient financial markets so that it could easily accumulate financial and human capital. By keeping an eye on the financial market efficiency, Mercedes-Benz  can successfully stay ahead of the competition.",
            "Mercedes-Benz  should review the economic growth rate of the countries while making international expansion decisions. Countries with high economic growth rates provide more opportunities to pursue long-term growth objectives. A slow economic growth rate leads towards more cautious spending by consumers, which can directly affect Mercedes-Benz’s revenue growth.",
            "The rising inflation rate can have a negative impact on the revenue growth of Mercedes-Benz  as its decreases the purchasing power of money and discourages consumer spending on goods and services.",
            "Fluctuations in the exchange rate can affect business profitability. Mercedes-Benz  should study the exchange rate fluctuations to make accurate anticipations so that the undesired trade and business performance consequences could be avoided.  High-interest rate means Mercedes-Benz  will make high-interest payments, and taken loans will cost more in the long run.",
            "Entering in mature industries that are approaching saturation point can achieve growth objectives more challenging for Mercedes-Benz . Therefore, the industry lifecycle stage must be considered while choosing the countries for international expansion.",
            "The performance of Mercedes-Benz  heavily depends on the skills and competencies of its workforce. The timely availability of skilled workers is crucial for Mercedes-Benz to stay ahead of the competition. Mercedes-Benz  should analyze the labour demand and supply trends to understand how workers with the required skills set could be successfully recruited.  A rigid labour market with powerful worker unions can cause various problems for Mercedes-Benz . Like, it may pressure the Mercedes-Benz to give an unfair wage raise, or may halt the production process by giving a strike call. Hence, it is important to analyze the labour market dynamics, anticipate the key trends and adapt the talent management strategies accordingly.",
            "In the PESTEL framework, social factors represent the key demographic characteristics, social values, norms, and customs of the society in which business organization functions. Mercedes-Benz  must carefully handle the social factors, as failure to adapt according to the socio-cultural environment has driven many highly successful business organizations towards failure. This article section discusses the implications of some key social factors for Mercedes-Benz .",
            "The consumption behaviour shares a strong link with the economic factors. When consumers have more disposable income and are willing to spend more on goods and services to improve their lifestyle, it provides exciting growth opportunities to Mercedes-Benz , as introducing new products and services to these customers is easier, and revenue growth chances also remain higher. However, as modern consumers are becoming more demanding, it is important for Mercedes-Benz  to carefully analyze their consumption/spending patterns preferences so that the marketing mix strategies could be adapted accordingly. It is also important for Mercedes-Benz  to understand whether the consumption is driven by utilitarian or hedonic motivations. Another important consumer behaviour variable that can affect the Mercedes-Benz’s performance is the degree of ethnocentrism. Higher ethnocentrism can make the business environment more challenging for Mercedes-Benz while operating in the international markets.",
            "High population growth and rising proportion of young population segment are two favourable demographic indicators for Mercedes-Benz , when it specifically targets young consumers with its products/services. Other than that, it is also important for Mercedes-Benz  to study the host country’s attitude towards migration, as a positive attitude in terms of welcoming the immigrants from different cultural backgrounds indicates the importance of adopting effective diversity management practices. Mercedes-Benz  should adapt its marketing strategies to ensure diversity and inclusion. A positive attitude towards migration also reflects that Mercedes-Benz  can easily recruit staff from diversified cultural backgrounds. High workplace diversity is often linked with higher productivity, better innovation, and improved overall firm performance.",
            "Social class stratification and respect for hierarchy are some important social factors that can influence the business, marketing, and human resource management strategies of Mercedes-Benz . A hierarchal structure with formal work culture suits Mercedes-Benz  when entering countries with high power distance. Similarly, higher social stratification also indicates the need to adopt effective market segmentation strategies, as Mercedes-Benz cannot target multiple segments from different social classes with the same marketing mix.",
            "Each country has its unique cultural norms, values, and traditions, which reflect consumer behavior. Inability to adapt the product/service offerings according to local cultural traditions can cause serious harm to the business. Mercedes-Benz  must conduct extensive research to gain local consumer knowledge. Being an international firm from a culturally distant home market, it could be difficult for Mercedes-Benz management to understand the delicate cultural nuances. For this purpose, Mercedes-Benz can develop a business partnership with local market players that could offer in-depth information about cultural norms and values that influence consumers’ perceptions and attitudes towards the brand.",
            "Another important factor to be considered when developing business strategies is the gender role in that particular society. The marketing and advertising strategies in a highly patriarchal culture would be adapted according to prevailing patriarchal norms, otherwise, Mercedes-Benz  can receive a backlash from consumers and general society. The gender roles in that particular society could also affect the human resource management strategies of Mercedes-Benz , as the company will find it difficult to ensure gender diversity across all management levels in countries where women are considered primarily responsible for managing domestic responsibilities.",
            "In today’s business world when technological development pace is accelerating, and business organizations are extensively investing in emerging technologies to stay ahead of the competition, it is important for Mercedes-Benz  to study and anticipate the existing and future technological trends to ensure long-term business survival. This article section outlines some technological factors that have important implications for Mercedes-Benz .",
            "Mercedes-Benz  should prefer countries with well-developed technological infrastructure, as supportive technological infrastructure makes it easier for a firm to achieve its cost reduction, innovation, and value creation objectives. Well-developed technological infrastructure also reflects that it will be harder for Mercedes-Benz  to derive sustainable competitive advantage from technology, which could be easily imitated by competitors.",
            "Technological innovation rate and development can affect the overall market and industry. By studying the emerging technological innovation trends, Mercedes-Benz  will be able to understand the new product development rate, product life cycle length, and innovative features being mostly liked by consumers. Research into consumers’ attitudes towards emerging innovative digital technologies can help Mercedes-Benz  in understanding whether shifting to e-commerce will benefit more than opening a physical outlet. Competitors’ investment in automation technologies to reduce costs can compel the Mercedes-Benz to shift from manual to automated procedures, particularly when people in general in that particular society are tech-savvy. By investing in the right technological innovations, Mercedes-Benz can optimize the user experience, achieve operational efficiencies, and position itself as an innovative organization.",
            "The research and development trend in chosen industry/region reflects the pro-activeness of firms towards introducing innovative solutions for consumers’ needs. However, Mercedes-Benz  must refine its understanding of how emerging technological innovations can benefit the firm besides creating value for customers. Extensive investment in research and development activities would be required in markets characterized by disruptive technologies. However, it is important for Mercedes-Benz  to adopt a long-term horizon, and do not expect a short-term return from its research and development efforts.",
            "Environmental analysis has gained significant importance in the contemporary business environment due to the increased vigilance of stakeholders towards sustainability and environment protection. Mercedes-Benz  should gain an in-depth understanding of environmental regulations to avoid lawsuits and reputational harm in the market. Implications of some important environmental factors are discussed below.",
            "Stringent environmental regulations in many countries are pressurizing business organizations to reduce environmental harm. In response, Mercedes-Benz  should adopt responsible production practices, encourage responsible consumption practices among its targeted consumers, try to improve its brand image on sustainability grounds, and ensure full compliance with the international and local environmental regulations, as inability to do so can draw the serious, reputation damaging criticism from relevant stakeholders.",
            "The emergence of renewable technologies to reduce dependence on natural resources has emerged as a powerful trend in various sectors. Mercedes-Benz  should evaluate the extent to which a country’s technological infrastructure supports the use of renewable technologies to capture this environmental trend. In some world regions, governments offer attractive subsidies on the use of renewable energy sources. By taking the advantage, Mercedes-Benz  can incur investment in renewable energy sources to achieve sustainable business development objectives.",
            "In some countries, the adoption of the closed-loop, circular economy principle is becoming a common norm in some industries/regions. Industries with supportive institutional mechanisms can make material recycling and re-using easier. Similarly, in some countries, customers take an active part in the recycling process. Mercedes-Benz  can benefit from these sustainability trends and use them as a tool to not only reduce the environmental costs but also achieve economic objectives in form of reduced production costs.",
            "Lastly, weather conditions need to be considered as operational cost, efficiency, and employee productivity can derive a strong influence from the local weather conditions. Weather conditions also shape consumer behaviour, and require Mercedes-Benz to integrate flexibility into its supply chain operations.",
            "Unlike political factors that offer a broader view, legal factors provide more detailed and specific information related to different laws and regulations, mainly including- employment laws, health and safety laws, intellectual property laws, and consumer protection laws. Mercedes-Benz  can face expensive lawsuits if it fails to comply with the host countries’ legislations.",
            "Employment law is an umbrella term that covers various laws protecting employees’ rights, such as fair wage, equality, equity, inclusion, fairness, health, and safety. In some countries, there is no effective enforcement of employment laws, but some countries impose strict penalties upon violation of any of the employees’ stated rights. While entering/operating in those countries, Mercedes-Benz  should ensure work environment safety. Proper mechanisms must be placed to discourage any sort of direct and indirect discrimination. Effective compliance with the employment laws can help Mercedes-Benz in strengthening its employer brand image, which is important for attracting and retaining the top talent from the market amid the ongoing war for talent.",
            "Strict compliance with the intellectual property laws makes the business environment safer for firms like Mercedes-Benz , as their patents are protected from imitation, leading towards sustainable competitive advantage.",
            "In many countries, a variety of federal and state-level laws are in place to protect consumers from potential exploitation by businesses. In the information technology age, the laws have even become stricter to ensure consumers’ privacy. In the case of online transactions, Mercedes-Benz must strictly comply with the data protection regulations to avoid lawsuits. While entering different countries, Mercedes-Benz management needs to study the laws related to refund, discount, credit terms, quality, misleading advertisement, and maximum pricing (particularly in the case of basic essential goods).",
            "The article ends with some concluding remarks about the overall effectiveness of the PESTEL framework as a strategic planning tool for modern business organizations.",
            "PESTEL is a powerful strategic planning tool that can provide valuable guidance to the Mercedes-Benz  in making successful business strategies. An in-depth understanding of external environmental dynamics enables Mercedes-Benz  to make the right international business expansion decisions. Mercedes-Benz can stay ahead of the competition by timely identifying the opportunities and threats imposed by external business environment, and adapting business strategies accordingly.",

        "paragraphs": [
            "German Election 2025:Germans are heading to the polls on Sunday in a crucial national election, with opinion polls indicating that a change in leadership and a new governing coalition are on the horizon.",
            "Unlike previous elections, which have often been predictable, this campaign has been marked by dramatic developments.",
            "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), faced a major political setback last November when he dismissed his finance minister. The move led to a vote of confidence, which he lost, forcing early elections.",
            "Adding to the political turmoil, tech billionaire Elon Musk publicly backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). This endorsement triggered a national debate about Germany’s historical responsibility, with Scholz condemning Musk’s stance as “disgusting,” according toCNN.",
            "The AfD is now positioned to make history, with polls suggesting it could become the country’s second-largest political force—a first for a far-right party since World War II.",
            "The Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the party of former Chancellor Angela Merkel, is leading in the polls, with its candidate Friedrich Merz seen as the frontrunner. The CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU, are projected to reclaim their dominance in German politics.",
            "Merz has taken a tougher stance on immigration compared to Merkel’s open-border policies. He pushed for stricter immigration laws, even attempting to pass legislation with the support of the AfD—an unprecedented move that sparked protests. However, Merz later clarified toCNNthat working with the AfD was “not an option.”",
            "Alice Weidel, co-leader of the AfD, has built her campaign around anti-immigration policies. The party saw significant gains in regional elections last year, and polls now place it at around 20% nationally.",
            "Weidel has vowed to enforce “remigration”—a term linked to Nazi-era policies—by closing borders and deporting undocumented migrants. Speaking at an AfD rally, where Musk appeared via video link, she toldCNNthat this would be one of her first actions as chancellor.",
            "The SPD, which won the 2021 election, now risks a major defeat, with polls predicting a significant drop in support. Scholz’s coalition government, known as the “traffic light” coalition due to its alliance with the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP), has been plagued by internal conflicts, leading to growing discontent among voters.",
            "One survey last year ranked Scholz as Germany’s least popular chancellor since reunification. Speculation even arose that Defence Minister Boris Pistorius could replace him as the SPD’s candidate, though this did not happen.",
            "The Greens, polling at about 13%, are unlikely to win outright but could play a key role in coalition negotiations. Their candidate, Robert Habeck, currently serves as Germany’s economics minister.",
            "Immigration has dominated the election debate, especially following several high-profile attacks linked to asylum seekers. Scholz introduced border checks with neighbouring European countries to address security concerns, a move seen as an attempt to win back voters shifting towards the AfD.",
            "The economy is another critical issue. Once Europe’s economic powerhouse, Germany has seen its GDP shrink for two consecutive years. Challenges include the aftermath of Russia’s war in Ukraine, increasing competition from China in the automotive sector, and potential trade tensions with the United States underDonald Trump’s administration.",
            "Germany’s car industry, a pillar of its economy, is struggling. Volkswagen and other manufacturers face possible mass layoffs and factory closures, raising concerns about the country’s long-term economic stability.",
            "Germany’s political systemrarely allows a single party to govern alone, meaning coalition talks will follow Sunday’s vote. Past negotiations have taken weeks or even months to form a government.",
            "One thing appears certain: despite its strong polling, the AfD is unlikely to be part of any governing coalition, as other parties have ruled out working with it.",
            "As Germany waits for the election results, one challenge remains clear—the next government will face tough decisions in steering the country through a period of political and economic uncertainty.",
            "TISS has begun an investigation into a student's sexual harassment and bullying accusations against a resigned assistant professor. The complaint, addressed to the chancellor and Minister of Education, describes the professor's advances and threatening actions. The institute has verified the complaint and launched an inquiry through its Internal Complaint Committee (ICC).",

        "title": "PESTLE Analysis of Mercedes Benz | Business Management & Marketing",
        "paragraphs": [
            "Mercedes Benz Group is an automobile manufacturing German multinational company. Gottlieb Daimler and Carl Benz founded the automobile company in 1883. The company has a production capacity of producing approximately 2491600 vehicles in 2023. Today, we’ll discuss the PESTLE analysis of Mercedes Benz; it focuses on external environmental factors like; political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental factors.",
            "Some of the main political factors in the Mercedes Benz PESTLE analysis are as follows;",
            "The trade policy of countries keeps on changing depending on various economic, political, and geographic factors. For instance, the Pakistani government and other developing countries banned the import of luxury vehicles of Mercedes Benz and other brands. It was because of the fact that they had limited resources in their foreign reserve and other financial reasons.",
            "Countries and governments change their taxation policy depending on foreign and international relations. For instance, if a globalized and open political party comes into power, they focus on a free trade policy and lower taxation policy to attract potential new investors. On the other hand, the nationalistic government would oppose global influence and they would increase taxes to discourage potential new investors.",
            "A stable political environment plays a key role in the growth of businesses and companies. Mercedes Benz procures raw materials, automobile parts, tools, components, and equipment from various countries. In case of political turmoil, roadblocks, procession, and other conflicts, they would disrupt the supply chain and distribution of materials, parts, and components. It negatively impacts the production and manufacturing processes of the company.",
            "Some of the main economic factors in the Mercedes Benz PESTLE analysis are as follows;",
            "The country’s interest rate is one of the main economic and financial indicators and it directly impacts the sales and revenue of Mercedes Benz. For instance, if the central bank increases the interest rate, it makes the business loans expensive; discourages potential new investors, and decreases the sale of automobiles. This is because people prefer to save their disposable income due to higher interest rates, instead of buying luxury vehicles.",
            "The country’s inflation rate is the other key economic indicator and it negatively impacts buying power of people. For instance, when the government and the central bank start printing more currency notes to pay off their local debts, then it decreases the original value of the existing currency. As a result, things become unaffordable to many people, and they stop buying luxury products.",
            "Some of the main social factors in the Mercedes Benz PESTEL analysis are as follows;",
            "The global population has been increasing significantly for the past few years. The living standards and financial condition of people have been improving due to the entrepreneurial mindset and financial awareness. The changing demographics with more resources increased their affordability and it makes them desire and buy luxury vehicles for a better traveling experience.",
            "The cultural norms of different societies in various countries play a key role in the growth of businesses and companies. Some cultures don’t appreciate and value luxury products and boastful attitudes. On the other hand, it is normal and acceptable to market and advertise luxury vehicles and artifacts. Mercedes Benz should carefully analyze the cultural factors while launching and advertising its products in another country.",
            "Some of the main technological factors in the Mercedes Benz PESTEL analysis are as follows;",
            "Mercedes Benz has developed an advanced e-commerce platform to keep up with the growing online shopping trends. The online platform allows the company to connect and engage with the targeted customer market directly without involving any intermediaries. Most importantly, it allows them to customize their vehicle order based on their specific needs and demands.",
            "Mercedes Benz invests a significant amount of capital resources in research and technological development. It allows them to develop unique designs and achieve operational efficiency by developing efficient parts and equipment. As a result, it helps the company to develop and design vehicles and cars with more features of safety and comfort to increase the overall traveling experience of customers.",
            "Some of the main legal factors in the Mercedes Benz PESTEL analysis are as follows;",
            "Mercedes Benz should comply with the consumer safety and vehicle safety and security laws of different countries. It comprises developing safe and secure vehicles for customers, and regulatory compliance would help the automobile brand to smoothly perform its production and distribution operations without any delays and disruption.",
            "Mercedes Benz has a very large database of workers and employees in various countries and the company’s supplier factories. The automobile brand should comply with labor laws, working conditions, employment contracts, compensation, and benefits.",
            "Some of the main environmental factors in the Mercedes Benz PESTEL analysis are as follows;",
            "Mercedes Benz has made a strong commitment to environmental sustainability. The automobile brand has taken various environmental sustainability initiatives like developing electric automobiles, hybrid vehicles, fuel-efficient cars, renewable sources of energy, and using sustainable materials to decrease the carbon emission rate and the carbon impact on the environment.",
            "After an in-depth study of the pestle analysis of Mercedes Benz; we have realized that Mercedes Benz is the world’s leading luxury automobile brand. If you are learning about the Mercedes Benz PESTLE analysis; then you should keep in mind the abovementioned external environmental factors like; political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental.",

        "title": "Debt brake: How this fiscal rule could shape Germany’s election | Explainer News | Al Jazeera",
        "paragraphs": [
            "German election: Candidates face tough choices on defence, trade amid shifting US policies",
            "As Germans prepare to vote on Sunday, their country’s sluggish economic growth will be top of their minds along with immigration and the Ukraine war.",
            "A fiscal mechanism known as the debt brake, which strictly limits government borrowing, has become a fault line in German politics with the last government’s collapse blamed on the issue.",
            "The world’s third largest economy shrank for the second straight year as its politicians are asking whether this fiscal straightjacket is hindering investment that could boost growth.",
            "And while a significant number of potential voters remain undecided, Friedrich Merz’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is the clear favourite to become the biggest party in parliament. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has made major gains in popularity in recent years on the back of an anti-immigration agenda, and polls put it in second place.",
            "So what’s a debt brake, and why has it become a major election issue in the eurozone’s largest economy?",
            "The debt brake, or “Schuldenbremse”, caps the federal government’s new borrowing at 0.35 percent of Germany’s gross domestic product (GDP) – except in emergencies – and bars its 16 states from taking on new debt. It is designed to prevent irresponsible government spending.",
            "It was introduced in 2009 under former Chancellor Angela Merkel in the wake of the global financial crisis. While the rule took effect in 2016, it was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic and again after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The legislation was reinstated last year.",
            "In her recent memoir, Merkel called for Germany to relax its debt brake in a sign of growing political pressure to overhaul a rule that many economists have said is too inflexible.",
            "Germany has the lowest public debt of the large eurozone economies. In Italy, the government debt ratio equals 141 percent of its GDP. In France, it’s 112 percent. In Germany, it’s just 65 percent. In the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) view, debt sustainability is not a pressing issue for Berlin.",
            "And that reflects in the public opinion. Fifty-five percent of Germans now support upending strict borrowing limits, compared with 32 percent in July, according to a January poll by Forsa on behalf of the German Council on Foreign Relations.",
            "Before this weekend’s elections, polls show that money is at the top of voters’ minds. And for good reason. Economic growth has been anaemic since 2019 and negative since 2023. Forecasters are also pencilling in falling growth for 2025.",
            "Long considered a manufacturing powerhouse, Germany has struggled to fend off growing competition from China. Industrial work as a share of total employment has declined from 40 percent in 1990 to 27 percent today.",
            "Germany’s sputtering industrial sector could be further hit by a potential trade war with the United States. Demand for its key exports – machinery, cars and industrial tools – fluctuates with wider global growth, which would fall in the event of higher global tariffs.",
            "The country’s ageing transport, energy and housing infrastructure also needs upgrading.",
            "Elsewhere, Berlin spends 2.1 percent of its GDP on defence, a touch above NATO’s annual target. But that is thanks to a 100-billion-euro ($105bn) fund created for the war in Ukraine. The fund is expected to run dry by 2027, and Berlin will face tough questions on how to meet its NATO obligations without breaking its fiscal rules.",
            "To make matters worse, Germany’s population is ageing. The number of people older than 64 is projected to grow by 41 percent to 24 million by 2050, accounting for nearly one-third of the population. The ratio of working to retired people will fall, which will lead to a shrinking tax base.",
            "Concerns about the strength of Germany’s economy have also undermined private investment, which is further contained by elevated corporate tax rates.",
            "Still, the debt brake has inhibited successive governments from large-scale spending projects. Public investment has remained stable at about 2 to 3 percent of GDP in recent years, which is low compared with other countries in the region.",
            "The upshot is that Germany’s motorway authority has identified 45 billion euros ($47bn) of investment needs, there is a nationwide shortage of 800,000 homes and the stated aim of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2045 will require tens of billions of euros of extra spending every year.",
            "Addressing Germany’s numerous structural challenges will cost about 600 billion euros ($628bn) by 2030, according to the German Economic Institute.",
            "Many economists are calling on the government to leverage its fiscal wiggle room to boost output.",
            "“Any serious efforts to fundamentally reform and improve the German economy will have to come with fiscal stimulus,” Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro research at the Dutch bank ING, told clients in a note.",
            "He added: “Finding the fiscal space for all the required policies exclusively in austerity looks like a mission impossible.” As such, any new government “will have to agree on looser fiscal policies [i.e., relaxing the debt brake],” Brzeski said.",
            "The debt brake was largely behind the collapse of the governing coalition in November. Chancellor Olaf Scholz pushed for it to be suspended in the draft budget to pay for additional spending in Ukraine. But this was resisted by Finance Minister Christian Lindner from the coalition partner Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner was later dismissed.",
            "With no party set to win a straightforward majority in Sunday’s elections, coalition talks are likely to drag on for months. The new government’s first priority would be to agree on budgets for this year and 2026.",
            "While Merz, the clear frontrunner to become chancellor, has promised to “uphold” the debt brake, he has also left the door open for change.",
            "“Of course, it can be reformed,” Merz said. “The question is why, for what purpose.” He said he won’t pursue extra borrowing for more welfare spending. But if extra borrowing were to boost investment “then the answer may be different,” he said.",
            "Broadly, the liberal FDP, the conservative CDU and the far-right AfD want to cut government red tape, reduce welfare benefits and preserve existing fiscal rules. On the flipside, left-wing parties, such as Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens want the debt brake to be relaxed and for public investment to rise.",
            "According to Shahin Vallee, a senior research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations, “the economic slowdown has taken a toll on the political situation.”",
            "Many commentators believe that years of low growth and simmering economic frustration are partly responsible for the rise of the anti-establishment AfD.",
            "Germany’s central bank has long called for tweaks to the fiscal mechanism that would permit small increases in borrowing. Most pundits expect only a limited relaxing rather than a complete overhaul of the borrowing cap.",
            "But even that won’t be easy. Any change to the rule would require a two-thirds majority in both the upper and lower houses of parliament. The AfD, which blames low growth on environmental regulations and mass immigration, opposes fiscal reform as does Lindner’s FDP.",
            "Although Merz recently passed anti-immigration legislation with the AfD’s backing, he has refused to form a coalition government with the party, which is expected to win 20 percent of Sunday’s vote.",
            "As such, Merz will have to form a coalition with one or two of the parties in Scholz’s government, the SPD and the Greens, which are polling in third and second place before the elections.",
            "One possibility would be for the SPD and the Greens to condition their entry into a coalition with Merz on him agreeing to remove certain spending items – notably on climate change-linked investments – from the brake altogether.",
            "For Vallee, debt brake reform is now firmly “on the table … as there is a growing consensus in Germany that fiscal policy will have to be amended. I think deep down, Merz is secretly happy to be forced into higher public spending by a [left-wing] coalition partner.”"

            "In the EU, the transport sector is the only sector with increasing GHG emissions compared to 1990. While harmful emissions have decreased due to successful regulation, transport performance, fossil fuel consumption and thus CO2emissions have continued to increase, despite powertrain efficiency improvements. Meaningful regulation, which can be market-based (MBI) and non-market-based (NMBI) by nature, is needed to meet climate targets. To understand the mechanisms, effects and limitations of MBI and NMBI, this study investigates and evaluates selected regulations in the German road transportation sector until 2020. Therefore, this study identifies, describes, and categorizes environmental policy instrument types. Based on this step, selected instruments in the road transportation sector are identified by their type and implemented policies are described and assessed. Furthermore, an assessment methodology is developed to evaluate and score target achievement, cost-efficiency and practical feasibility by linking the outcomes of instruments to its goals. Based on the findings of this assessment, conclusions and recommendations are developed and discussed. Finally, results and general properties of policies and their type of instruments are extrapolated, and general statements about market and non-market-based instruments in a broader context for future regulation and market designs are projected. The study discovers that fuel producers and distributors, vehicle manufacturers and sellers are directly regulated by non-marked-based instruments, despite the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). On the customer side, primarily market-based implemented except for low-emission zones, which are direct regulations. The study finds that holistic representation and realistic internalization of external effects in a market is complex and will never be complete. Still, sufficient representation can be enough to drive transformation in the transport sector. The CO2price itself is not sufficiently representing the consequential costs of climate change induced by road transport, but it helps to make low-carbon alternatives economically viable. Overall, the study finds that most implemented regulations in the German road transport sector were successful in relation to their goals.",

            "Burning fossil hydrocarbons releases energy by forming, among other airborne substances, carbon dioxide (CO2). This combustion product is released as waste into the atmosphere. The vast amount of CO2produced by human activities throughout the last 150 years is slowly causing an imbalance in the earth´s climate system, resulting in climate change. This change can create significant threats to nations, societies and—apart from other environmental damage—human existence. Therefore, the global society has decided to limit additional fossil fuel-based CO2emissions to keep global warming well below 1.5 °C relative to pre-industrial times.",
            "As a consequence, societies need to transition toward a more sustainable and CO2-neutral energy system. A wide spectrum of very diverse policy instruments (EPI) has been developed in recent years to address the various sources of climate change and to move our society toward less GHG emissions. These policy instruments are based on various principles—such as polluter pays or prevention principles—and differ in their way of operation.",
            "While within the European Union (EU), the power and industrial sector decreased their CO2—and other harmful—emissions during the last decades, the road transportation sector emission levels have steadily increased. But also, road transportation capacity and individual passenger mobility demand rose during this timeframe. Therefore, improvements in efficiency have been fully compensated in terms of the overall CO2emissions from this sector. In addition, projections show that especially the commercial road transportation demand will continue to grow within the EU.",
            "To address this development and to force the transportation sector to contribute to CO2mitigation, well-designed environmental policy instruments need to be applied to accelerate the shift to low- or even zero-carbon transport technologies and behaviors. Within this context, assessing such instruments already applied within the transportation sector within the EU is fundamental.",
            "The present study identifies, describes, and categorizes environmental policy instrument types (see Additional file1). Based on this step, applied instruments in the road transportation sector are identified by their type and implemented policies are described and assessed.

            "Road transport has a significant impact on the climate. The German transport sector emitted 164 Mil. tons CO2eq in 2019 (pre-COVID), representing 20% of German GHG emissions. 160 million tons of CO2eq were produced alone by the road transport sector (see Additional file1: 10 and 11). Compared to 1990, the transport sector has shown no total reduction in GHG emissions, while its share increased by 7% of total German GHG emissions [74]. The final energy demand (FED) from transport slightly decreased from 655 TWh in 1990 to 638 TWh in 2019, a reduction of 2.6%. In 2019, the road transport sector represented 592 TWh representing 93% of transport sectors FED (see Additional file1: 12 and 13) [38,64]. The number of registered passenger cars steadily increased from 30,6 Mil. in 1990 to 47,1 Mil. Cars in 2019 (2021: 48,3 Mil.) in Germany [66]. Furthermore, the average power of cars increased by 66% between 1995 and 2019. Cars became 11% heavier due to a rising share of sport utility vehicles (SUV) [47]. In 2019, 98% of cars were fueled by petrol (66%) and diesel (32%), while alternative powertrains were only 2% (see Additional file1: 12) [1,56]. More supporting statistics are shown in Additional file1in chapter 3. The data indicate that Germany's road transportation sector has not moved toward climate neutrality since 1990. Similar behavior can be observed in other European countries. Therefore, a bouquet of various environmental policy instruments was implemented to reduce the transport sector's impact on tackling the road transport sector. Further policy and revisions are yet to come due to the “fit for 55” package.",
            "Different environmental policy instruments have been applied to realize environmental protection within this sector [55]. Some instruments focus on mitigating relative or specific emissions or performance standards, while others aim to reduce the overall absolute emission amount. Figure1places the regulations applied in the context of total emission reductions. Total emissions are a product of the total fuel demand and the emission intensity of the respective vehicles. Therefore, reducing total emissions can be achieved by mitigating one or all of those factors. While the fuel demand depends on user behavior, the emission intensity is related to the fuel type and the respective vehicle specifications. Each of these factors can be addressed with different environmental policy instruments to meet the set goals.",
            "Relation of policy instruments in 2020 in road transport according to the total emissions",
            "For example, the German government regulates—partly based on EU Directives—the transport sector by a spectrum of environmental policy instruments with overall 42 policies in 2021 [53]. Table1summarizes the central policies in road transportation in Germany. Non-market-based instruments are mainly applied for minimizing harmful emissions from fuels and exhaust gases (burning products). Market-based instruments are additionally used for emission reductions, e.g., by vehicle taxation—based on vehicle properties—and consumption of fuels. These instruments are listed by their objective downward the supply chain. Notably, non-market-based instruments are preferably applied to producers and distributors, whereas market-based instruments are chosen for consumer regulation. From a lifecycle assessment standpoint, cradle-to-gate impacts are regulated by non-market-based instruments, as markets do not fully internalize all relevant (external) effects for a holistic assessment. ETS certificates required to produce fuels and vehicles are not mentioned, because this is not a road transportation-specific mechanism.",

            "Mmarket-based,NMnon-market-based,PCpassenger car,CVcommercial vehicles,EVelectric vehicles",
            "Thus, CO2emissions are regulated by different instruments in Germany. On the one hand, CO2is controlled passively by preferences of the fuel, CO2fleet limits and car labeling. On the other hand, market-based instruments policed by vehicle, energy and CO2taxes are based on the polluter-pays principle. Consequently, the transportation sector has a higher implicit CO2price compared to the explicit costs for CO2within the ETS [45].",
            "Environmental policy instruments affect different areas of the economy, environment, and society. Therefore, the evaluation of such instruments is based on the assessment of target achievement, cost-effectiveness, and practical feasibility [45], adopted from the EU environmental policy evaluation. Relevant studies and data sets are investigated for each criterion to emphasize key performance points.",
            "Target Achievementmeasures whether and to which degree a policy achieves the set objectives or goals. A policy measure serves different objectives, although a hierarchy of the different objectives is not necessarily discernible. Emissions reduction is often the explicit or implicit goal of such an environmental policy instrument. Explicit regulations target the issue directly, while implicit policies target the reduction by regulating an objective related to emissions. Results of target achievement can be different: Policy outcomes (e.g., laws and directives issued), outputs (e.g., the share of biofuels), and impacts (e.g., mitigation of risks resulting from climate change).",
            "Cost-efficiencyrelates the inputs (cost) and results (effects) of policy intervention. It provides an economic metric for efficiency and helps to compare different instrument types [45]. The efficiency can be related to microeconomic cost (e.g., implementation cost for technology from a producer/consumer perspective) or macroeconomic cost (e.g., the social cost of health issues induced by air pollution). Furthermore, micro- and macroeconomic costs can be compared to each other. Efficiency is divided into its static and dynamic components. Static efficiency reflects the most favorable avoidance variant at a given time (low-hanging-fruit principle; see Additional file1: 1.6). The dynamic efficiency considers an intervention over a certain period. As a future-oriented criterion, dynamic efficiency necessarily contains an element of uncertainty. Since the cost and profitability of new technologies cannot be forecasted with certainty, it will also be difficult to accurately determine the efficient level of investment in low-carbon technology innovation and diffusion. To assess the cost-effectiveness of policy measures, the cumulative net costs discounted over time need to be considered. In a macroeconomic framework, this also includes the opportunity costs of investment [11,45]. In this analysis, the cost-efficiency represents the magnitude of the cost impacts of a measure in relation to their achieved targets, based on studies made for each applied instrument.",
            "Practical feasibilityis a very heterogeneous criterion set. It summarizes other evaluation criteria associated with the instruments and the field applied. The various criteria thus refer to the difference between policies as designed on the drawing board and their actual implementation in practice. Therefore, they are grouped under the heading of feasibility. The spectrum of possible sub-criteria can include administrative implementation (e.g., reporting and review effort), unintended side effects, political acceptability, legal and institutional feasibility, flexibility, risk, and uncertainties [45].",
            "Each environmental policy instrument reviewed with the criteria defined in Sect. 2.3 is scored in a three-step range. The applied spectrum is presented in Table2. As the criterion practical feasibility is heterogeneous, the scoring is related to its impact on the relevant sub-criteria. The evaluation takes place from the regulator's perspective or with a focus on the impact on society. For this purpose, the micro-economic costs (private-sector) incurred are placed in context with macroeconomic costs. Since the objectives of the environmental policy instruments (EPI) differ by their type, no overarching quantified assessment can be made here, either on an absolute or a relative scale. In some cases, several EPIs pursue the same reduction targets and changes, but the respective share of each EPI cannot be reliably determined. For example, CO2tax and energy tax both directly aim at a decline in demand and, therefore, indirectly at emissions reduction.",
            "Scores and description",
            "Moreover, the technological development (implied by the market pressure) toward higher efficiency, lower fuel consumption—and thus low emissions—is naturally brought about by lower operating costs. Reduction of CO2is thus automatically enforced by the market if fuel prices are sufficiently high. In contrast, reducing harmful emissions—covered by Euro standards—does not entail any cost savings for the user.",
            "In the following, the applied instruments in the German road transportation sector are evaluated. Therefore, each instrument (shown in Table1) is described, its targets are identified, the performance related to the criteria (shown in 2.3) is evaluated, and each performance key point is scored (based on Table2).",
            "The Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) and its amendments establish environmental requirements for gasoline and diesel fuels to reduce their emissions of air pollutants issued by the EU. The FQD combined with the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) set standards for environmental emissions. The RED II targets to increase the share of renewable energy consumption mix by 32% by 2030, and the member states require fuel suppliers to include a minimum of 14% renewable energy consumed in rail and road transport. Besides the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) Implementing Directive, the ILUC Directive and the “Winter Package” contain further the regulations for fuel suppliers [25].",
            "The targets of the fuel quality directive until 2020 can be summarized as follows [25,33]:",
            "Contribute to enhanced air quality",
            "Contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction and biofuels sustainability. Reduction of the average life cycle GHG intensity of transport fuels brought into the market by a minimum of 6% by the end of 2020 (Indirect land-use change (ILUC) is not taken into account)",
            "Reduce impacts on health and environment from transport fuels",
            "Reduce greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions from the transport sector",
            "Ensure proper functioning of engines and after-treatment systems",
            "Guarantee the quality of petrol and diesel",
            "Ensure a single market for fuel (setting minimum standards for selected specifications)",
            "In the following, the performance of key aspects for the selected criteria is summarized and shown in detail in Table3.",
            "Most of the targets set for the FQD have been achieved, although the total GHG reduction targets have only been met partly or not at all. For example, only 62% of the life cycle GHG intensity reduction goal of 6% has been completed within the EU (excluding ILUC). Furthermore, no absolute CO2reduction was achieved by the FQD; instead, CO2emissions increased due to an increased demand for fuels. However, the FQD does not directly handle fuel demand (see Fig.1). The CO2intensity reduction of 3.1% by 2020 has led to a less pronounced increase in emissions and is, thus—despite missing the target—to be assessed as positive and in line with the policies overarching goals [15,22].",
            "The cost-efficiency assessment is primarily based on an evaluation of the European Commission from 2017. As the FQD is the only instrument directly aiming at the GHG intensity of fuels, the related costs cannot be compared and set into context with similar measures. The RED indirectly aims to reduce GHG intensity by setting goals for renewable energy shares. The costs mainly occur at a micro-economic level, which means at the industry or consumer level (unless the monitoring costs), while the benefits are at a macro-economic level. The occurring costs for the fuel distributors are at a much lower magnitude than the benefits for society due to avoided damage costs from harmful emissions.",

            "While the FQD regulates the fuel supply side, emissions standards are a common instrument regulating emissions from vehicles that manufacturers must abide by. In Europe, two types of emission standards are applied. Non-CO2emissions are limited by the Euro norms for all road vehicles (as described in the following), whereas the CO2fleet limits regulate CO2emissions of passenger cars and LDVs [30].",
            "The Euro norms are emission standards for passenger cars and commercial vehicles for motor vehicles and their specific replacement parts [25]. The policy aims to protect air quality, (indirectly) improve fuel economy, and encourage technological development and innovation [30]. The policy covers a wide range of tailpipe, evaporative and crankcase emissions. Thus, in-cylinder and after-treatment technologies were developed and implemented. Exclusively, harmful pollutants are regulated: carbon-monoxide (CO), non-methane hydrocarbons and total hydrocarbons (CnHm), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and particle number (PN) [25].",
            "Table4describes the evolution of Euro Norms for light-duty vehicles. Several technologies to mitigate pollution became mandatory, and as the test procedures changed, real driving emissions were included. Emissions are measured in the use of a vehicle on the road. The International Council of Clean Transportation (ICCT) provides further studies on the emission standards compliances costs for diesel LDV and HDV, including estimated costs for EURO 7 [59,60].",
            "Evolution of emission standards for light-duty vehicles [41]",
            "As these tests are hard to reproduce on the road, real driving emissions were higher than those reported in laboratory tests, resulting in a confirmation factor by the EU that relates laboratory and real driving emissions [2]. The EU limits air pollution to mitigate cardiovascular diseases and premature statistical deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) provides its Air Quality Guideline recommendations for outdoor and indoor pollution limits. The WHO defines the limits on several short- and long-term exposure studies investigating exposure–effect relationships. Lower limits are based on the so-called NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level), which shows no related effect of pollutants on health issues. Especially, particular matter shows a harmful impact on health with every pollution level and is associated with the particular size. Limit values result from a political balancing process, whereas health improvements versus feasibility and costs of the actions are weighted [63].",
            "In 2017, WLTP and real-driving emission tests were introduced to improve testing procedures for passenger cars. New cars must pass these tests in real driving conditions and improved laboratory tests before receiving approval for European roads. Euro IV became mandatory for heavy-duty vehicles in 2013 [19]. Since 2019, newly produced trucks must determine and declare their CO2emissions and fuel consumption with the latest version of the Vehicle Energy Consumption calculation Tool (VECTO) which was developed by the European Commission [34]. Furthermore, real driving emissions are tested by the verification testing procedure (VTP) to verify emissions and fuel consumption from July 2020 [30].",
            "The implementation of the Euro standards generates additional costs due to the mandatory technologies to reduce emissions to achieve the targets. The costs were estimated by the ICCT in 2012 and are shown in Table5. According to Euro 1, gasoline cars were required to switch from carburetor to electronic fuel injection systems and install catalytic converters, which are more complex and more costly. From Euro 2, the costs for emissions reduction in diesel LDVs to meet regulations were always higher than for gasoline LDVs. Especially the mandatory installation of particulate filters (Euro 4) and selective catalytic reduction catalysts (SCR) led to increasing costs for diesel vehicles. The average car price in 2012 was 30,000 $, which resulted in a cost-share of 1% for gasoline and 5—6% for diesel LDVs [42]. However, the introduction of Euro 6 made gasoline particle filter necessary for some cars to meet the regulations, which implied costs for the transition of Euro 5 to Euro 6 for gasoline cars. These—not mandatory, but for some cars necessary—particle filter costs are not estimated in the cited study.",

As the performance of passenger cars and light-duty vehicles is mobility itself, performance defined for heavy-duty is related to the transport capacity of a wide range of vehicle sizes.

However, even if the verifiable use of low-carbon fuels is accepted for the CO2fleet limits, the vehicles still have to meet the Euro norms regarding harmful emissions from combustion. At the time of conduction of this study, the discussion has not been solved.

With the introduction of the WLTP test cycle, specific CO2emissions increased slightly due to a more demanding and realistic driving cycle. Until 2006, no mandatory regulations were set, and the voluntary agreements of car manufacturers only led to a reduction of 1.2% of specific emissions on average per year. When the regulation was announced in 2006, the average reduction rate increased to 2.4% per year. In 2009, the regulation was implemented, which increased the reduction rate to 3.2% on average. During the voluntary agreement phase, the relative reduction between 2000 and 2006 was 6.3%. The announcement and implementation of the policy led to a decrease of 24.2% between 2006 (161 gCO2/km) and 2019 (122 gCO2/km).

Furthermore, the calculation became more complicated as it differentiates between vehicle types and size criteria. Typical criteria are fuels (diesel, gasoline, alternative), type (car, commercial vehicles, motorcycles and more), emission standard (Euro Norm), registration year, CO2emissions (WLTP), and gross vehicle weight (commercial vehicles) [55,81].

The tax per liter is about 0.47 € for diesel and 0.67 € for gas, although the carbon- and thus the energy content of diesel is significantly higher [80]. The lower cost of diesel is because, in 2003, the EU adopted a directive to standardize oil prices. To reduce the distortion of competition between industries, a possibility of \"special tax treatment\" was introduced for diesel [37].

In the long term, the plan is to transfer the national systems within the EU to the EU ETS [16]. Sweden and Switzerland already implemented CO2tax several years ago, but as their economies, population, GDP and land area are fully different, the results of this tax type are hard to project on Germany. In Germany, the CO2tax was recently implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic impacted fuel and energy consumption of the (road) transport sector heavily [74].

Therefore, specific emissions can be reduced by implementing measures (e.g., fleet limits), but economic growth or side- and rebound effects might lead to higher transportation performance (e.g., more driven kilometers, traffic volume), nullifying the improvement from an emissions perspective. Other underlying reasons are changes in purchase power and processes of social change.",
            "Some of the criteria can only be applied to the respective instruments to a limited extent. For example, the focus on CO2 effectiveness shows that some instruments do not have a direct CO2 reduction target but have an indirect effect, such as the Euro standard.",

            "Qualitative assessment of efficiency is also difficult, as the costs and benefits are incurred in different places that are not directly offset against each other. This study prefers the macroeconomic view of costs to the microeconomic perspective.",
            "While microeconomic costs are relevant for companies and individuals to implement a policy, macroeconomic costs are crucial for using mechanisms and instruments. Since EPIs pursue societal goals, such as environmental protection, CO2 reduction, and air quality, the countervailing macroeconomic costs must be considered first.",

            "The results identify several characteristics of non-market-based instruments. Performance standards and technology mandates are popular direct regulations in the road transport sector (FQD, Euro Norm, CO2fleet limit, directive on mobile air conditioning systems).",
            "Direct regulation is difficult to implement but can take effect very quickly and is helpful for urgent problems. Thus, direct regulation has been used in the Montreal Protocol for CFC Mitigation or emissions standards (Euro Norms). However, NMBIs are very static by nature, as they are designed for specific circumstances and, therefore, do not adapt well to change (e.g., technological innovations). Moreover, they require the regulator in charge to reasonably predict technical and environmental conditions. Regulatory measures often have legislative gaps and are very complex when it comes to covering a large field. This property makes these measures—once established—resistant to innovation for alternative problem-solving.",
            "A regulatory measure initially appears as a simple solution to a problem, but it entails a series of significant issues, revisions and adjustments. However, the effectiveness of direct interventions is undisputed. Still, economic efficiency suffers from the intervention and severely limits the ability of the regulated group to act, thus reducing the potential for alternative and innovative solutions.",
            "The market often relies on government assistance, as seen in the transportation transition. Direct interventions—such as technology mandates—can be critical in planning government investments in necessary infrastructure. For example, the development of a charging station infrastructure, which precedes the (indirect) technology mandate of battery–electric mobility, stands in competition with developing a hydrogen refueling station network from an investment perspective. However, as governments face a limited budget and both paths call for intense investment, the regulator must decide. This decision, however, significantly limits producers’ and customers’ choices.",
            "Market-based instruments, especially emissions trading, represent economically more efficient approaches and do not restrict the range of solutions to the same extent. However, a fundamental problem of economic evaluation arises here:",
            "The market and its imperfections:",
            "As markets only cover a specific area of economic and private behavior and interactions with nature, an incomplete representation of reality arises. Thus, external effects which have not yet been internalized—i.e., not monetized and thus not appearing in the market system—do not affect the decision-making of market participants.",
            "History has shown that many relevant external effects on the economy and environment are not internalized in market systems. For example, social costs created from respiratory diseases related to air pollution from fossil fuel burning in power plants and the mobility sector are not represented in the fuels’ cost structure. Other consequences are decreased quality of life, lower life expectancy, or loss of workforce due to induced illness by air pollution. As those effects are hard to internalize, governments decided to directly regulate air pollution (Euro standard and low emission zones). Furthermore, transport performance is not related to its eco-efficiency, which means high-emission vehicles can have the same transport performance but cause more air pollution. These costs only occur partly as higher fuel costs. The consumers’ perspective only shows higher fuel consumption and, therefore, higher transport costs, but these do not represent the actual occurring costs. As a result, many effects occur as social costs and remain public.",
            "External effects, which affect markets, are called missing markets. Therefore, the scopes of the existing markets must be expanded to provide a sufficient representation of actual behavior and its effects (currently occurring as externalities and social costs).",
            "An example of this is the ban on internal combustion vehicles. This mandate is an inefficient solution from an internalized market perspective as there are cheaper ways to reduce CO2(low-hanging fruit principle). However, harmful emissions to health are not priced in existing cost structures yet. Therefore, the occurring costs on the health system are not represented in this price, leading to an insufficient representation. Consequences are the reduced quality of life, costs of treatments and lost work due to respiratory illnesses. Insufficient internalization of costs can be found in various energy policy examples in Germany (coal mining in the Ruhr area, nuclear power).",
            "The economic view causes tension to arise between cost-efficiency indicators and generational fairness. There is a dilemma between static and dynamic efficiency: On the one hand, static efficiency is most relevant to align with the current economic situation and represents economic values like the return of investment or liquidity. Due to market imperfections, even static efficiency is not representing the actual costs of behaviors and might lead to a wrong path from a long-term perspective. Static efficiency does not include social costs, as those occur in the future. On the other hand, dynamic efficiency can represent these effects, but it is hard to predict, as future costs are highly uncertain. Static and dynamic efficiency can be weighed against each other using the interest rate and inflation. Thus, the return on investment of static efficiency is lower from the perspective of (future) dynamic efficiency. Furthermore, cost-efficiency indicators are different from micro and macroeconomic perspectives, leading to tension between governments and market participants.",
            "Internalizing external effects is crucial for a realistic—or at least sufficient—market representation of behaviors and economic actions. Regarding the market representation of climate change effects, CO2is ideally suited as an evaluation system for a spectrum of external effects. The concept of the global warming potential can convert the climate impact of different (atmospheric) gases into a single unit—CO2eq—which is reflected in the market via a price, thus combining these systems. However, the internalization of CO2has some limitations:",
            "The instrument mainly focuses on emissions from fossil fuels. A complete representation of emissions will require a holistic assessment, such as the cradle-to-grave approach.",
            "Time preference: Time preference describes how a resource used today is valued compared to the ability to use the same resource in the future. Assuming that the CO2budget is limited until 2050 or the end of the century, CO2becomes a resource that can only be \"used up\" to a certain extent. How the budget is used up over time presents the dilemma between current and future consumption.",
            "The pricing scheme in emission trading systems still does not reflect emissions' time preference, as CO2 pricing in emissions trading is statically formed.",
            "The comparison of current and future use of resources can be represented in a CO2interest rate. Thus, it can be argued that CO2 valuation shows a similar behavior with similar problems as a currency.",
            "Therefore, it can be argued that CO2 as the currency of our climate—when it is sufficiently developed and other externalities are internalized—could be the market-side representation of human interaction with nature.",
            "As long as a market system does not reflect all—or at least the most relevant—external effects of economic trade, a purely market-oriented approach via emissions trading are neither effective nor sufficiently reflects reality.",
            "Therefore, internalizing other relevant external effects is desirable and leads to more market-oriented approaches, openness to solutions, and a reduced necessity for direct regulations. A realistic monetary representation is complicated in some cases (quality of life, happiness, health). Whether all relevant external effects can be realistically mapped on the market side at all borders remains a technical, if not a philosophical question. In conclusion, with regard to the study results, it can be claimed that there seems to be a historical development from direct regulations to a more market-oriented search for solutions using market mechanisms, such as competition and efficiency enhancement. Integration of CO2into the market system allows comparing emissions to other cost factors, with the CO2price reflecting the weighting of this cost factor in the overall bill.",
            "Even though the actual costs of today's emissions are not yet fully reflected, the market systems are improving by internalization, and it is important to encourage this development. Nevertheless, the support of the market system by regulatory measures will continue to be necessary, mainly if market actions cause external effects that are hard to monetize.",

            "(Feb. 9, 2017) On January 25, 2017, the German government agreed on a draft act that would allow the driver to transfer control of the vehicle to highly or fully automated driving systems and for those vehicles to be used on public roads. Completely autonomous driving, meaning the driving system controls the vehicle completely and there are no drivers, only passengers, would not be allowed. (Gesetzentwurf der Bundesregierung, Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Änderung des Straßenverkehrsgesetzes[Draft Act of the Federal Government, Draft Act to Amend the Road Traffic Act] (Draft Act), Deutscher Bundesrat: Drucksachen und Protokolle [BR-Drs.] 69/17 (Jan. 27, 2017), Bundesrat website.)“Highly automated driving systems” are defined as systems that the driver does not need to monitor all the time. The system alerts the driver if he or she has to take over the driving functions.  (Die Bundesregierung [The Federal Government],Gesetz im Kabinett: Automatisiertes Fahren auf dem Weg[Law from the Cabinet: Automated Driving on the Way] (Jan. 25, 2017), Federal Government website.)“Fully automated driving systems” are defined as driving systems that the driver does not need to monitor.  The driving system is capable of establishing a “minimal risk situation” at all times.  (Id.)Features of the Draft LawThe draft act contains the following provisions:The driver would be allowed to transfer driving tasks to a highly or fully automated driving system that conforms to international requirements (e.g., those contained in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic or in European Union legislation) if the system is used in accordance with its intended purpose. (Draft Act, § 1a.)The driver would be obligated to take over the driving functions from the automated driving system without undue delay if the driving system told him to do so or if the driver realized or should have realized that the conditions for using an automated driving system were no longer fulfilled, e.g., if a tire were damaged. (Id. § 1b.)A “black box” in the car would record whether the vehicle was being controlled by the driver or by the driving system. In addition, it would record when the vehicle requested the driver to take over or when there was a technical malfunction of the automated driving system. The records would have to be made available to the authorities upon request. (Id.§ 63a.)If someone were to die or be injured in an accident due to the malfunctioning of a fully or highly automated driving system, the maximum amount that the victim would be allowed to recover would be raised to €10 million (about US$10.8 million), double the current maximum of €5 million for all driving accident cases. (Id. § 12.)Next Procedural StepsThe Federal Government forwarded the draft act to the Bundesrat for discussion. The Bundesrat, the constitutional body through which the German states participate in the legislative process, generally has six weeks to debate draft legislation.  (Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany(May 23, 1949), BGBl. I at 1,as amended, art. 76 ¶ 2, GERMAN LAWS ONLINE (unofficial English translation).) Due to the “particular urgency” of this act, the Federal Government set a shorter deadline of three weeks.  (Id.)  After the deadline has passed, the Federal Government will forward the draft act, along with the comments of the Bundesrat, to the German Bundestag (parliament) for discussion.  (Id.)The draft act is one of several measures to create a legal framework to implement the “Strategy on Automated and Interconnected Driving” of the Federal Government. (Bundesministerium für Verkehr und Digitale Infrastruktur (BMVI) [Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure],Strategie automatisiertes und vernetztes Fahren[Strategy on Automated and Interconnected Driving] (Sept. 2015), BMVI website.)

            "As Europe’s largest economy, Germany is a major destination for foreign direct investment (FDI) and has accumulated a vast stock of FDI over time.  Germany is consistently ranked as one of the most attractive investment destinations based on its stable legal environment, reliable infrastructure, highly skilled workforce, positive social climate, and world-class research and development.",
            "Foreign investment in Germany mainly originates from other European countries, the United States, and Japan, although FDI from emerging economies (and China) has grown over 2015-2018 from low levels. The United States is the leading source of non-European FDI in Germany.",
            "The German government continues to strengthen provisions for national security screening of inward investment in reaction to an increasing number of high-risk acquisitions of German companies by foreign investors in recent years, particularly from China.  In 2018, the government lowered the threshold for the screening of investments, allowing authorities to screen acquisitions by foreign entities of at least 10 percent of voting rights of German companies that operate or provide services related to critical infrastructure. The amendment also added media companies to the list of sensitive businesses.",
            "Further amendments enacted in 2020 to implement the 2019 EU FDI Screening Regulation, which Germany strongly supported, include to:",
            "a) facilitate a more pro-active screening based on “prospective impairment” of public order or security by an acquisition, rather than ade factothreat, b) take into account the impact on other EU member states, and c) formally suspend transactions during the screening process.",
            "Furthermore, acquisitions by foreign government-owned or -funded entities will now trigger a review, and the healthcare industry will be considered a sensitive sector to which the stricter 10% threshold applies. A further amendment, in force since May 2021, introduced a list of sensitive sectors and technologies (similar to the current list of critical infrastructure) including artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, specialized robots, semiconductors, additive manufacturing and quantum technology, among others. Foreign investors who seek to acquire at least 10% of voting rights of a German company in one of those fields would be required to notify the government and potentially become subject to an investment review.",
            "German legal, regulatory, and accounting systems can be complex but are generally transparent and consistent with developed-market norms.  Businesses operate within a well-regulated, albeit relatively high-cost, environment. Foreign and domestic investors are treated equally when it comes to investment incentives or the establishment and protection of real and intellectual property.  Foreign investors can rely on the German legal system to enforce laws and contracts; at the same time, this system requires investors to closely track their legal obligations. New investors should ensure they have the necessary legal expertise, either in-house or outside counsel, to meet all national and EU regulations.",

            "The German government and industry actively encourage foreign investment. U.S. investment continues to account for a significant share of Germany’s FDI. The 1956 U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation affords U.S. investors national treatment and provides for the free movement of capital between the United States and Germany. As an OECD member, Germany adheres to the OECD National Treatment Instrument and the OECD Codes of Liberalization of Capital Movements and of Invisible Operations.  The Foreign Trade and Payments Act and the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance provide the legal basis for the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy to review acquisitions of domestic companies by foreign buyers, to assess whether these transactions pose a risk to the public order or national security (for example, when the investment pertains to critical infrastructure).  For many decades, Germany has experienced significant inbound investment, which is widely recognized as a considerable contributor to Germany’s growth and prosperity. The investment-related challenges facing foreign companies are broadly the same as face domestic firms, e.g relatively high tax rates, stringent environmental regulations, and labor laws that complicate hiring and dismissals.

Amendments to implement the 2019 EU Screening Regulation are already in force or have been drafted as of March 2021.

In the case of acquisitions of critical infrastructure and companies in sensitive sectors, the threshold for triggering an investment review by the government is 10 percent. The Foreign Trade and Payments Act and the Foreign Trade and Payments Ordinance provide the legal basis for screening investments. In 2019, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy screened a total of 106 foreign acquisitions. In at least one case it prohibited an acquisition – the planned takeover of German wireless communications technology developer IMST GmbH by Chinese state-owned defense company CASIC in December 2020. However, even without a formal decision, the mere prospect of rejection has reportedly caused foreign investors to pull out of prospective deals in the past. All national security decisions by the ministry can be appealed in administrative courts.",

The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy may launch a review within three months after obtaining knowledge of the acquisition; the review must be concluded within four months after receipt of the full set of relevant documents. An investor may also request a binding certificate of non-objection from the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy in advance of the planned acquisition to obtain legal certainty at an early stage.

The Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy may open a formal review procedure if a foreign investor seeks to acquire at least 10 percent of voting rights of a German company in a sensitive security area within three months after receiving notification, or the acquisition shall be deemed as approved.

An amendment in June 2017 clarified the scope for review and gave the government more time to conduct reviews, in reaction to an increasing number of acquisitions of German companies by foreign investors with apparent ties to national governments. The amended provisions provide a clearer definition of sectors in which foreign investment can pose a threat to public order and security, including operators of critical infrastructure, developers of software to run critical infrastructure, telecommunications operators or companies involved in telecom surveillance, cloud computing network operators and service providers, and telematics companies, and which are subject to notification requirements. The new rules also extended the time to assess a cross-sector foreign investment from two to four months, and for investments in sensitive sectors, from one to three months, and introduced the possibility of retroactively initiating assessments for a period of five years after the conclusion of an acquisition. Indirect acquisitions such as those through a Germany- or EU-based affiliate company are now also explicitly subject to the new rules.",

To achieve this goal, the amendments expand the powers of the FCO to act earlier and more broadly.

Germany has a very open economy, routinely ranking among the top countries in the world for exports and inward and outward foreign direct investment. As a member of the Eurozone, Germany does not have sole national authority over international payments, which are a shared task of the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the 19 member states, including the German Central Bank (Bundesbank). A European framework for national security screening of foreign investments, which entered into force in April 2019, provides a basis under European law to restrict capital movements into Germany on the basis of threats to national security. Global investors see Germany as a safe place to invest, as the real economy – up until the COVID-19 crisis– continued to outperform other EU countries.German sovereign bonds continue to retain their “safe haven” status.",

The KAGB represents the implementation of additional financial market regulatory reforms, committed to in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.

            "Although corporate financing via capital markets is on the rise, Germany’s financial system remains mostly bank-based. Bank loans are still the predominant form of funding for firms, particularly the small- and medium-sized enterprises that comprise Germany’s “Mittelstand,” or mid-sized industrial market leaders. Credit is available at market-determined rates to both domestic and foreign investors, and a variety of credit instruments are available. Legal, regulatory and accounting systems are generally transparent and consistent with international banking norms. Germany has a universal banking system regulated by federal authorities, and there have been no reports of a shortage of credit in the German economy. After 2010, Germany banned some forms of speculative trading, most importantly “naked short selling.” In 2013, Germany passed a law requiring banks to separate riskier activities such as proprietary trading into a legally separate, fully capitalized unit that has no guarantee or access to financing from the deposit-taking part of the bank. Since the creation of the European single supervisory mechanism (SSM) in November 2014, the European Central Bank directly supervises 21 banks located in Germany (as of January 2021) among them four subsidiaries of foreign banks.",
            "Germany supports a global financial transaction tax and is pursuing the introduction of such a tax along with other EU member states.",
            "Germany has a modern and open banking sector that is characterized by a highly diversified and decentralized, small-scale structure. As a result, it is extremely competitive, profit margins notably in the retail sector are low and the banking sector considered “over-banked” and in need of consolidation. The country’s “three-pillar” banking system consists of private commercial banks, cooperative banks, and public banks (savings banks/Sparkassen and the regional state-owned banks/Landesbanken). This structure has remained unchanged despite marked consolidation within each “pillar” since the financial crisis in 2008/9. The number of state banks (Landesbanken) dropped from 12 to 5, that of savings banks from 446 in 2007 to 374 at the end of 2019 and the number of cooperative banks has dropped from 1,234 to 814. Two of the five large private sector banks have exited the market (Dresdner, Postbank). The balance sheet total of German banks dropped from 304 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 265 percent of end-2019 GDP with banking sector assets worth €9.1 trillion. Market shares in corporate finance of the banking groups remained largely unchanged (all figures for end of 2019): Credit institutions 27 percent (domestic 17 percent, foreign banks 10 percent), savings banks 31 percent, state banks 10 percent, credit cooperative banks 21 percent, promotional banks 6 percent.",
            "The private bank sector is dominated by globally active banks Deutsche Bank (Germany’s largest bank by balance sheet total) and Commerzbank (fourth largest bank), with balance sheets of €1.3 trillion and €466.6 billion respectively (2019 figures). Commerzbank received €18 billion in financial assistance from the federal government in 2009, for which the government took a 25 percent stake in the bank (now reduced to 15.6 percent). Merger talks between Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank failed in 2019. The second largest of the top ten German banks is DZ Bank, the central institution of the Cooperative Finance Group (after its merger with WGZ Bank in July 2016), followed by German branches of large international banks (UniCredit Bank or HVB, ING-Diba), development banks (KfW Group, NRW.Bank), and state banks (LBBW, Bayern LB, Helaba, NordLB).",
            "German banks’ profitability deteriorated in the years prior to the COVID-19 crisis due to the prevailing low and negative interest rate environment that narrowed margins on new loans irrespective of debtors’ credit worthiness, poor trading results and new competitors from the fintech sector, and low cost efficiency. In 2018, according to the latest data by the Deutsche Bundesbank (Germany’s central bank), German credit institutions reported a pre-tax profit of €18.9 billion or 0.23 percent of total assets. Their net interest income remained below its long-term average to €87.2 billion despite dynamic credit growth (19 percent since end-2014 until end-2019 in retail and 23 percent in corporate loans) on ongoing cost-reduction efforts. Thanks to continued favorable domestic economic conditions, their risk provisioning has been at an all time low. Their average return on equity before tax in 2018 slipped to 3.74 percent (after tax: 2.4 percent) (with savings banks generating a higher return, big banks a lower return, and Landesbanken a –2.45 percent return). Both return on equity and return on assets were at their lowest level since 2010.",

The Wirecard insolvency led to the replacement of the head of banking supervisory authority BaFin and triggered both an ongoing overhaul of the German banking supervision and a continuing parliamentary investigation.",
            "It remains unclear how the COVID-19 crisis will affect the German banking sector. Prior to the pandemic, the bleaker German economic outlook prompted a greater need for value adjustment and write-downs in lending business. German banks’ ratio of non-performing loans was low going into the crisis (1.24 percent). In March 2020, the German government provided large-scale asset guarantees to banks (in certain instances covering 100 percent of the credit risk) via the German government owned KfW bank to avoid a credit crunch. So far, German banks have come through the crisis unscathed thanks to extensive liquidity assistance from the ECB, moratoria and fiscal support for the economy. Nevertheless, 25 German banks were downgraded in 2020 and many more were put on negative watch, though CDS spreads for the two largest private banks have fallen dramatically since the height of the crisis in March 2020 and are currently around pre-COVID levels. The second and third COVID-waves, however, are likely to take a toll on credit institutions and 2021 could prove to be the toughest test for banks since the 2008/9 global financial crisis. According to the Bundesbank, loan defaults by German banks could quadruple to 0.8 percent of the loan portfolio (or €13 billion). The Bundesbank’s focus in particular is on aircraft loans. According to Bloomberg’s calculations, the major German regional banks have lent €15 billion for aircraft financing. At Deka alone, the asset manager of the savings banks, the ratio of non-performing loans in aircraft financing is at a relatively high 7.7 percent.",

It has been a part of the Eurosystem since 1999, sharing responsibility with the other national central banks and the European Central Bank (ECB) for the single currency, and thus has no scope to manipulate the bloc’s exchange rate. Germany’s persistently high current account surplus – the world’s second largest in 2020 at USD 261 billion (6.9 percent of GDP) – has shrunk for the fifth year in a row. Despite the decrease, the persistence of Germany’s surplus remains a matter of international controversy. German policymakers view the large surplus as the result of market forces rather than active government policies, while the European Commission (EC) and IMF have called on authorities to rebalance towards domestic sources of economic growth by expanding public investment, using available fiscal space, and other policy choices that boost domestic demand.",

The administrative authority for imposing anti-money laundering requirements on financial institutions is the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin).",
            "The Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) – located at the General Customs Directorate in the Federal Ministry of Finance – is the national central authority for receiving, collecting and analyzing reports of suspicious financial transactions that may be related to money laundering or terrorist financing. On January 1, 2020, legislation to implement the 5th EU Money Laundering Directive and the European Funds Transfers Regulation (Geldtransfer-Verordnung) entered into force. The Act amends the German Money Laundering Act (Geldwäschegesetz – GwG) and a number of further laws. It provides, inter alia, the FIU and prosecutors with expanded access to data. On March 9, 2021 the Bundestag passed an anti-money laundering law seeking to improve Germany’s criminal legal framework for combating money laundering while simultaneously implementing the EU’s 6th Money Laundering Directive (EU 2018/1673 – hereafter “the Directive”). The Directive lays down minimum rules on the definition of criminal offenses and sanctions to combat money laundering. The law goes beyond the minimum standard set out in the Directive by broadening the definition of activities that could be prosecuted as money laundering offenses. Previously, the money laundering section in the German Criminal Code was designed to criminalize acts in connection with a list of serious “predicate offenses,” the underlying crime generating illicit funds, e.g., drug trafficking. The new law dispenses with the previously defined list, allowing any crime to be considered as a “predicate offense” to money laundering (the “All- Crimes Approach”). This is a paradigm shift in German criminal law, and implements an additional priority laid out in Germany’s “Strategy to Combat Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing” adopted in 2019.",
            "The number of suspected money laundering and terrorist financing cases rose sharply in 2019 from 77.000 suspicious activity reports (SARs) to 114.914 according to the 2019 annual report of FIU (a new record and 12-fold that of 2009). The vast majority (98 percent) of suspicious transaction reports were filed by German banks and other financial institutions in order to avoid legal risks after a court ruling that held anti-money laundering (AML) officers personally liable, thus including many “false positives”. At the same time, the activities resulted in just 156 criminal charges, 133 indictments and only 54 verdicts.",
            "In its annual report 2018, the FIU noted an “extreme vulnerability” in Germany’s real estate market to money laundering activities. Transparency International found that about €30 billion in illicit funds were funneled into German real estate in 2017. The results of the first concerted action by supervisory authorities of the German federal states in the automotive industry in 2019, for example, were sobering: only 15 percent of car dealers had implemented AML provisions, the rest had deficiencies, showing the “need for further sensitization.” The report also noted a slight upward trend in the number of SARs related to crypto assets. Around 760 SARs cited “anomalies in connection with cryptocurrencies”, as reporting noted, especially the forwarding of funds to trading platforms abroad for the exchange of funds into cryptocurrencies. However, the FIU itself has come under criticism. Financial institutions deplore the quality of its staff and the effectiveness of its work. The Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW) criticizes that the precautions taken to prevent money laundering in high-risk industries outside the financial sector are monitored much less intensively. A review of the FIU scheduled for 2020 has been postponed due to the pandemic.",

Appropriations for SOEs are included in public budgets, and SOEs can take two forms, either public or private law entities. Public law entities are recognized as legal personalities whose goal, tasks, and organization are established and defined via specific acts of legislation, with the best-known example being the publicly-owned promotional bank KfW (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau). KfW’s mandate is to promote global development. The government can also resort to ownership or participation in an entity governed by private law if the following conditions are met: doing so fulfills an important state interest, there is no better or more economical alternative, the financial responsibility of the federal government is limited, the government has appropriate supervisory influence, and yearly reports are published.",

The primary goal of such involvement is promoting public interests rather than generating profits. The government is required to close its ownership stake in a private entity if tasks change or technological progress provides more effective alternatives, though certain areas, particularly science and culture, remain permanent core government obligations. German SOEs are subject to the same taxes and the same value added tax rebate policies as their private sector competitors. There are no laws or rules that seek to ensure a primary or leading role for SOEs in certain sectors or industries. However, a white paper drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy in November 2019 outlines elements of a national industrial strategy, which includes the option of a temporary state participation in key technology companies as “last resort”. Private enterprises have the same access to financing as SOEs, including access to state-owned banks such as KfW.",

SOEs in 2018 had €609 billion in revenue and €583 billion in expenditures. 41 percent of SOEs’ revenue was generated by water and energy suppliers, 12 percent by health and social services, and 11 percent by transportation-related entities.

The federal government held a direct participation in 104 companies and an indirect participation in 433 companies at the end of 2018, most prominently Deutsche Bahn (100 percent share), Deutsche Telekom (32 percent share), and Deutsche Post (21 percent share). Federal government ownership is concentrated in the areas of infrastructure, economic development, science, administration/increasing efficiency, defense, development policy, culture. As the result of federal financial assistance packages from the federally-controlled Financial Market Stability Fund during the global financial crisis of 2008/9, the federal government still has a partial stake in several commercial banks, including a 15.6 percent share in Commerzbank, Germany’s second largest commercial bank.

In 2005, the European Commission successfully sued Germany at the European Court of Justice (ECJ), claiming the law impeded the free flow of capital.

            "The German labor force is generally highly skilled, well-educated, and productive. Before the economic downturn caused by COVID-19, employment in Germany had risen for the thirteenth consecutive year and reached an all-time high of 45.3 million in 2019, an increase of 402,000 (or 0.9 percent) from 2018—the highest level since German reunification in 1990. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, employment fell to 44.8 million in 2020.",
            "Simultaneously, unemployment had fallen by more than half since 2005, and, in 2019, reached the lowest average annual value since German reunification. In 2019, around 2.34 million people were registered as unemployed, corresponding to an unemployment rate of 5.2 percent, according to Germany Federal Employment Agency calculations. Using internationally comparable data from the European Union’s statistical office Eurostat, Germany had an average annual unemployment rate of 3.2 percent in 2019, the second lowest rate in the European Union. For the pandemic year 2020, the Federal Employment Agency reports an average unemployment rate of 5.9% with an average 2.7 million unemployed in 2020. This is an increase of 429,000 over 2019. However, long-term effects on the labor market, and the economy as a whole, due to COVID-19 are not yet fully observable. All employees are by law covered by the federal unemployment insurance that compensates for the lack of income for up to 24 months. A government-funded temporary furlough program allows companies to decrease their workforce and labor costs with layoffs and has helped mitigate a negative labor market impact in the short term. The government made intense use of this program, which enrolled at peak times in 2020 more than six million employees. The government, through the national employment agency, has spent more than 22 billion euros on this program, which it considers the main tool to keep unemployment low during the COVID-19 economic crisis. The government extended the program for all companies already meeting its conditions by the end of 2020 to December 31, 2021.",
            "Germany’s national youth unemployment rate was 5.8 percent in 2019, the lowest in the EU. The German vocational training system has gained international interest as a key contributor to Germany’s highly skilled workforce and its sustainably low youth unemployment rate. Germany’s so-called “dual vocational training,” a combination of theoretical courses taught at schools and practical application in the workplace, teaches and develops many of the skills employers need. Each year, there are more than 500,000 apprenticeship positions available in more than 340 recognized training professions, in all sectors of the economy and public administration. Approximately 50 percent of students choose to start an apprenticeship. The government is promoting apprenticeship opportunities, in partnership with industry, through the “National Pact to Promote Training and Young Skilled Workers.”",
            "An element of growing concern for German business is the aging and shrinking of the population, which (absent large-scale immigration) will likely result in labor shortages. Official forecasts at the behest of the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs predict that the current working age population will shrink by almost 3 million between 2010 and 2030, resulting in an overall shortage of workforce and skilled labor. Labor bottlenecks already constrain activity in many industries, occupations, and regions. The government has begun to enhance its efforts to ensure an adequate labor supply by improving programs to integrate women, elderly, young people, and foreign nationals into the labor market. The government has also facilitated the immigration of qualified workers.",
            "Labor Relations",
            "Germans consider the cooperation between labor unions and employer associations to be a fundamental principle of their social market economy and believe this has contributed to the country’s resilience during the economic and financial crisis. Insofar as job security for members is a core objective for German labor unions, unions often show restraint in collective bargaining in weak economic times and often can negotiate higher wages in strong economic conditions. In an international comparison, Germany is in the lower midrange with regards to strike numbers and intensity. All workers have the right to strike, except for civil servants (including teachers and police) and staff in sensitive or essential positions, such as members of the armed forces.",
            "Germany’s constitution, federal legislation, and government regulations contain provisions designed to protect the right of employees to form and join independent unions of their choice. The overwhelming majority of unionized workers are members of one of the eight largest unions — largely grouped by industry or service sector — which are affiliates of the German Trade Union Confederation (Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, DGB). Several smaller unions exist outside the DGB. Overall trade union membership has, however, been in decline over the last several years. In 2020, total DGB union membership amounted to less than 6 million. IG Metall is the largest German labor union with 2.2 million members, followed by the influential service sector union Ver.di (1.9 million members).",
            "The constitution and enabling legislation protect the right to collective bargaining, and agreements are legally binding to the parties. In 2019, 52 percent of non-self-employed workers were covered by a collective wage agreement.",
            "By law, workers can elect a works council in any private company employing at least five people. The rights of the works council include the right to be informed, to be consulted, and to participate in company decisions. Works councils often help labor and management to settle problems before they become disputes and disrupt work. In addition, “co-determination” laws give the workforce in medium-sized or large companies (corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships limited by shares, co-operatives, and mutual insurance companies) significant voting representation on the firms’ supervisory boards. This co-determination in the supervisory board extends to all company activities.",
            "From 2010 to 2019, real wages grew by 1.2 percent on average. Generous collective bargaining wage increases in 2019 (+3.2 percent) and the increase of the federal Germany-wide statutory minimum wage to €9.35 (USD 10.15) on January 1, 2020, led to 2.6 percent nominal wage increase. Real wages grew by 1.2 percent in 2019. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, real wages fell in 2020 by 1% over the previous year (preliminary figures).",
            "Labor costs increased by 3.4 percent in 2019. With an average labor cost of €35 (USD 41.20) per hour, Germany ranked seventh among the 27 EU-members states (EU average: €27.40/USD 32.26) in 2019.",
            "OPIC programs were available for the new states of eastern Germany for several years during the early 1990s following reunification but were later suspended due to economic and political progress which caused the region to “graduate” from OPIC coverage.
