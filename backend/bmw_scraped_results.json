            "The German equity market has been hitting one record after the other as the nation approaches its federal election on Feb. 23, fueled by a combination of political anticipation, strong corporate earnings, and the hope for peace talks in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The market’s composition, with its heavy weighting toward industrial and tech firms, has also positioned it well in the current global investment landscape, and the relative undervaluation of European stocks compared to the US market have further bolstered their appeal. The Morningstar Germany Index marked 19 all-time highs in only 34 trading days so far this year and is up by nearly 14%, surpassing both its European peers and the US market.Higher Government Spending Takes Center Stage“The market is currently pricing the best possible outcome of the elections”, said Carsten Roemheld, capital market strategist at Fidelity, in a webinar on Feb. 18. Investors, many from abroad, are confident that Friedrich Merz and his CDU party, currently leading the polls, will swiftly form a coalition and implement reforms such as loosening the “debt brake”, a constitutional law that limits the federal structural deficit to 0.35% of GDP.This measure, introduced in 2009 during the global financial crisis, aimed to prevent excessive government borrowing. Amending this constitutional law poses challenges, as it requires a two-thirds majority in both parliamentary chambers—a threshold difficult to achieve given Germany’s fragmented political landscape and the rising influence of populist parties. Such a vote would hinge on whether one or two smaller parties – including one that is strictly opposed to widening the fiscal deficit – garner enough votes enter parliament.“Without a loosening of Germany’s fiscal straitjacket enshrined in the constitution, Merz would find it difficult to convince his potential center-left coalition partner(s) to agree to serious pro-growth reforms”, Berenberg’s chief economist Holger Schmieding wrote in a research note on Feb. 17. “In addition, he would lack the fiscal space to ramp up military spending decisively while increasing public investment and easing the burden on companies and households with significant cuts in taxes and electricity charges at the same time.”A relaxation of the debt brake could lead to increased government spending on infrastructure, defense, and digitalization, providing a much-needed boost to the economy and benefiting sectors like construction, technology, and finance.The CDU is polling around 30-32% of the votes in the final week before the election, with its preferred coalition partners SPD and/or Greens coming in at around 14-17% and 12-14%, respectively. Markets assume the right-wing AfD will be excluded from power.Stock Market Records Come Against Backdrop of RecessionGermany’s stock rally comes against the backdrop of soured economic sentiment as Europe’s largest economy enters the third year of stagnation and lags its European neighbors in economic outlook. Germany has been in recession for the past two years, with GDP growth projected to stagnate at a meager 0.3% for 2025, according to the country’s economic ministry.Spain – the economic outperformer in the eurozone, recording a 3.2% growth in 2024 – comes in as a close second in equity performance.German businesses have faced numerous shocks in recent years that have hampered their operations and growth. The Covid pandemic caused widespread supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and economic slowdowns. This was followed by the energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war, which led to soaring energy prices, particularly affecting Germany’s industrial sector. Additionally, supply shocks from China, inflationary pressures, and rising interest rates have further strained businesses, while ongoing geopolitical tensions and trade uncertainties, including the threat of US tariffs under Trump’s new administration, have added to the economic challenges.The automotive and manufacturing industries are particularly exposed to the threat of tariffs, with companies scrambling to adapt supply chains to mitigate potential disruptions. Although investors have so far largely shrugged off these concerns, an escalation in trade tensions could introduce volatility to the market.“German DAX 40 companies generate 80% of their revenues outside of Germany, and around 24% in the US”, said Sören Hettler, head of investment strategy DZ Research, in an interview with Morningstar. This compares to less than 20% of revenues that the companies generate in their German home market.The performance of the local stock market is owed to a robust global economy, analysts at German bank Deka said in a research note on Feb. 17, noting that it is also clear that the European Central Bank will continue to lower its key interest rates this year. In contrast, investors awaiting interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve in the next few months may be disappointed. The widening spread between rates in the eurozone and the US could also provide tailwind for European equities, according to Morningstar’s European market strategist Michael Field.These Stocks Are Driving the German Equity RallyThe German stock market’s outperformance is not broad-based. Companies like SAPSAPhave been instrumental in pushing the market to record highs, with the software giant experiencing a 70% surge in its stock value over the past 12 months, accounting for more than 9% of the Morningstar Germany Index’s gains of 30% over that period.SiemensSIEand Deutsche TelekomDTEhave also seen significant gains, contributing 3.7% and 3.3% to the index’s gains in the past 12 months, respectively, according to data from Morningstar Direct. Siemens has experienced strong corporate earnings, driven by global demand for electrification and industrial offerings. Deutsche Telekom has also performed well in 2024, with plans to accelerate growth through advancements in artificial intelligence and a data-driven business model. Aerospace and defense company RheinmetallRHMhas gained more than 9% this week alone, primarily due to expectations of increased defense spending across Europe.The good performance comes with a caveat: Three of these stocks now trade in overvalued territory, and three are fairly valued, according to Morningstar fair value estimates.Investment Opportunities in German Stocks“Having performed strongly in 2024, German equities now screen as fairly valued, trading at just over 1 times on a price/fair value estimate basis. But, while they are not on the whole cheap currently, neither are they expensive,” Morningstar’s Field said. Of the 49 German stocks under Morningstar coverage, 24 are trading in undervalued territory. “We see numerous stock opportunities, with autos the area of most attractiveness.”Germany’s auto production has suffered from poor government policies, reducing competitiveness and driving investments abroad, according to Morningstar equity analyst Rella Suskin. The upcoming elections offer a chance for change, with political parties promising to boost industrial competitiveness.However, anticipated coalition governments may weaken these policies. “Without a focused strategic framework that promotes cost-competitiveness in Germany, original equipment manufacturers will continue to direct their investments overseas, while balancing this with the need to maintain their highly integrated German headquarters. This will continue to weigh on returns,” Suskin warns.Valuations of Major European and US MarketsDomestic Politics Matter More to Small- and Mid CapsValuation-conscious investors might also turn to mid and small-cap stocks, seeking opportunities in areas that have yet to see the same growth as large-caps. Many of these companies are more directly exposed to the German and European economy, making them more vulnerable to domestic policy shifts and macroeconomic fluctuations. Their performance has been mixed, with some benefiting from sector-specific trends such as digitalization, while others struggle with persistent economic stagnation. According to Sören Hettler from DZ Bank, mid-cap companies derive about 55% of their revenues from Europe, including a significant portion of 24% from Germany, making them more sensitive to local economic and political conditions.Especially mid- and small-cap companies that are more exposed to domestic economic policies are seeking clarity and stability post-election, he adds- “A new government committed to reducing bureaucracy and increasing investment in critical areas could enhance investor confidence and drive further capital inflows into the German market.”How Could the German Election Affect Bond Markets?Speculation about an easing of the debt brake helped push up bund yields after the abrupt ending of the German coalition government on Nov. 6, which led to this weekend’s snap elections. Higher spending would mean that Berlin has to issue more bonds, increasing supply and pushing down bond prices.In addition, the prospect of peace in Ukraine has driven yields higher after they dipped in late January and early February. “Financial markets are not only focused on positive growth prospects but also on the costs of securing and rebuilding Ukraine in the future”, Deka wrote in its Feb. 17 research note amid news that the US and Russia will start peace talks on Ukraine. “Europe will have to play a significant role in financing these efforts. This burden weighs on bond markets and has particularly driven up yields on German government bonds.”The author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

            "The Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks is assigned based on an analyst's estimate of a stocks fair value. It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst’s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance.

            "The Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar’s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar’s conviction in those products’ investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they’re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst’s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly.

        "title": "Germany’s car industry crisis - this is what may fix it",
        "paragraphs": [
            "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
            "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
            "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
            "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus – a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
            "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
            "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
            "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy – and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
            "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly – and supports millions of other jobs.",
            "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
            "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
            "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
            "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Shütz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
            "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
            "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 – in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US – the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
            "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
            "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold – 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example – their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
            "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
            "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly – that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Schütz.",
            "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
            "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
            "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about €5,300, compared with €4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
            "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged €62 per hour, compared to €29 in Spain and €20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
            "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
            "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China – much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Schütz.",
            "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
            "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
            "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
            "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers – and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
            "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
            "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
            "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself – and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
            "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
            "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
            "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
            "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
            "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
            "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
            "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  – in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
            "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
            "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
            "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
            "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
            "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
            "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Schütz.",
            "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
            "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
            "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
            "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
            "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
            "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
            "Simon Schütz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
            "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
            "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
            "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
            "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
            "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

            "BMW is one the leading luxury car manufacturers of the world. There are two major political factors which have recently affected BMW. Firstly, the escalation of the trade war between U.S.A. and China. And, secondly, the rising political uncertainty in the Europe largely because of Britain’s decision of taking an exit from the European Union. Since, higher taxes were imposed on the goods traded between U.S.A. and China; it weakened the stock markets and hence causing a decline in the stock prices in the automobile industry. Apart from the trade tension between the two countries, higher duties were imposed on U.S.A. on the import of Steel and Aluminum by the European Union. Also, Brexit i.e. Britain’s exit from the EU can have a negative impact on the company as it will increase trade restrictions causing increase in the costs and decrease in the volume. Moreover, the increase in trade restriction by U.S.A. can also cause the other countries to increase their tariffs on the goods traded with U.S.A. This can cause a decrease in the vehicles exported from the U.S.A. which will affect BMW negatively.",

            "Below are the economic factors in the PESTLE Analysis of BMW:",
            "Apart from the European Union, a major chunk BMW’s revenue comes from China and The United States of Nation. So, any uncertainty prevailing in these countries can adversely affect BMW.",
            "The increased investment done by BMW for the electrification of their drivetrain systems (which is responsible for providing power to the wheels) can increase its costs significantly. Also, the company aims to expand its production centers. Due to these factors, the company expects a significant reduction in its profits before taxes from 10675 million Euros to 9815 million Euros. Due to the recent investments, BMW’s Return on capital Employed (ROCE) in 2018 has also decreased as compared with 2017. Another point for concern for BMW is that the automobile sector is not expected to grow in 2019 as well. U.S.A. and China are likely to observe a negative growth i.e. 1.6% & 2.4% respectively. Also with pandemic in 2020-21, sales got affected but in 2023 things are improving for automobile sector.",

            "Following are the social factors impacting BMW PESTLE Analysis:",
            "The BMW Group has a presence in more than 140 nations. The BMW group has 3 divisions i.e. the automotive segment, the motorcycles and the financial services. A major chunk of BMW’s revenues come from its automotive segment with all its brands catering to the premium segment. BMW is focused on increasing its customer satisfaction. Apart from increasing customer satisfaction from its vehicles itself, BMW aims to provide extra services to improve their experience. The introduction of its BMW CarData service has allowed its customers to get services as per the requirements generated from the data captured. The Cardata service, thus, provides its customers with tailored solutions. BMW’s Mini makes use of the service “BMW Connected” to enhance its customer’s experience.",
            "The technological factors in the PESTLE Analysis of BMW are mentioned below:",
            "BMW Group realizes the importance to integrate technology in its vehicles and also in the services that it provides. BMU has opened an Autonomous Driving Campus in Germany recently which will be a facilitator in designing of the automated vehicles. The Campus has created around 1300 jobs for the people belonging to the IT sector. With the help of these people, BMW aims to explore technologies like artificial intelligence and integrate them in its solutions. Also, a new facility has also been opened in Beijing, China. Apart from the automation, this facility will also help in developing new digital services and working on the new age designs. With the company focusing on digitalization, it remains prone to Cyber attacks.",
            "Although the risks related to cyber crimes can never be mitigated, but BMW should continuously work towards implementing more secure techniques for the protection of their and customer’s data.",
            "Following are the legal factors in the BMW PESTLE Analysis:",
            "BMW Group has been subject to various legal problems all over the globe. In the year 2017, more than 100 of BMW’s customers complained about the engine failures while driving. About 30 of them had taken this matter to the court as well. Also, in the year 2018, more than 3, 00,000 cars manufactured between 2007 & 2011 were called back as they were also prone to complete engine failures while driving. Till date, about 90 of the BMW’s customers have also complained about the mysterious fires in their parked BMW’s. The South Korean Government charged a hefty fine of about $9.9 million to the BMW Group for allegedly hiding the problems related with the fires in its engines.",
            "In the BMW PESTLE Analysis, the environmental elements affecting its business are as below:",
            "The BMW Group has always been an organization famous for contributing towards the sustainability. The group has been contributing towards the UN Environment Program since 2001. In fact, the Group was the first in the automobile sector which came out with the post of an Environment Officer. BMW group has also reduced its carbon footprint by reducing the C02 emissions of its European vehicles by 42%.",
            "Also, with the introduction of electric vehicles, the CO2 emissions have further dropped. The BMW i3 is fully electric with zero carbon emissions. While their hybrid models have C02 emission as less as 45g/km.",

            "Contents",
            "BMW Group is affected by common political influences, such as theintroduction of new policies, regulations, and political corruption. But unlikes smaller corporations, BMW Group has an intense amount of funds, profits, and brand image. This means it can influence policies for the growth of the company.",
            "BMW Group is powered by more than 15 production companies worldwide. The manufacturing is efficient, but can also be halted by policies and regulations, like the end-of-life vehicle recycling system.",
            "Additionally, political instability affects BMW Group is in two ways: First, it can affect consumers’ ability to buy or change buying patterns directly. This is a concern in specific countries like Brazil, China, and Russia. And second, if BMW has invested in countries with political instability, those investments may be at risk.",
            "BMW Group has also allocated funds to influence political factors in favor of the company. One such incident pertains to Europe, whereBMW lobbied to slow down European plans to increase fuel efficiencyin cars by putting a stricter limit on carbon emissions.",
            "The company also emphasized its inclusion of greener technologies by developing the first common use of hydrogen passenger car. This car was developed because Europe taxes cars that heavily produce pollution.",
            "Several years ago, BMW Group topped the list for most reputable company. Now it consistently battles Toyota for the title. Who takes first place between the two depends on valuation. Back in 2012 BMW’s value hit a 10 percent increase whileToyota’s value fell by 10 percent.",
            "Global economy fluctuations also affect BMW’s performance, valuation, and profits. Specific regions, like Europe, can have a massive impact on the company’s success. And over the last few years the GDP has fluctuated. Fluctuations make it difficult for BMW Group to speculate profits and losses in the coming year since the currency is so volatile.",
            "Tariffs are also impactful to BMW. It’s possible to build a BMWin Mexicoand sell it to Europe without a tariff. However, if you build a BMW in the United States and then sell it to Europe, the company suffers a 10 percent tariff.",
            "Despite this quiet fear, BMW will be investing $600 million in a South Carolina plant. Tariffs increase the costs for necessary vehicle parts, such as steel and aluminum. South Carolina important more than $500 million worth of steel and aluminium in 2017 — with tariffs the cost will increase over $106 million. This will likely eat at BMW’s profits.See AlsoHow Many AP Classes Should You Be Taking?",
            "All countries have cultural differences that are unique to the country. This means BMW Group must adjust products and marketing to fit the people it sells to. This requires adaptation to each market; using a one-size fit all approach won’t yield results.",
            "BMW has manufacturing companies all over the world including China, South Africa, and Austria. The company chooses the location of these plants based on heavy research and development. This requires not only understanding who the consumers are and why they buy, but also the political and economic landscape.",
            "A part of knowing and using this knowledge involves the integration of social media. BMW has social media pages on all the major platforms.On Facebook it has over 13 millionfans and posts daily updates and entertaining images to provoke engagement from followers.",
            "Twitter is where the company often responds to customer inquiries, comments, and complaints. Although it doesn’t seem to have a dedicated customer service section to help people on a consistent basis, someone does respond to followers when necessary.",
            "Instagram is an easy choice for any car manufacturer. BMW boasts nearly 20 million followers and a feed of dazzling photos of their cars in various luxury locations. It’s a simple way to showcase BMW’s lavish lifestyle to the younger audiences that frequent Instagram.",
            "With so much competition in the automotive industry, the only way for any car brand to stand out is through innovation and adaptation. This involves adapting the newest technology into each car — everything from the latest parts to leisure options like Bluetooth, WiFi, and more. Considering BMW is known for its luxury, the company can’t afford to skip out on these “leisure” options because consumers have come to expect them.",
            "BMW Group also prides itself on innovation and mobility. The cars can come with automatic car parking, hybrid vehicles, and autonomous driving. This last one, autonomous driving, is a big topic in the automotive industry.Brands like Teslaare at the forefront of self-driving cars, but unlike them, BMW Group talks about bringing it to the public.",
            "BMW Group abidesby a host of copyright lawsrelated to its vehicles, as well as the technology incorporated, including WiFi and Bluetooth. It’s trickier because the Group must abide by the regulations in each country the vehicles are manufactured and sold. Any changes to these laws (in any given location) can pause or fully halt BMW’s performance and creation of new technologies.",
            "Nowadays, consumers worry about the health of the planet. And two major impactful problems are CO2 emissions and fuel-usage by cars. As a means to please this audience, BMW has dove headfirst into the development and distribution of hybrid car models. These cars use less fuel than the average.",

            "The automotive industry fueled Germany’s rise as Europe’s economic powerhouse. Now, that same sector is in crisis — and is taking the country down with it.",
            "Automakers are facing a perfect storm: a shift from the combustion engine, which showcased German engineering, to less complex electric vehicles where Germany doesn’t control crucial battery technology. They are also battling slumping demand for electric vehicles in Europe, high energy and labor costs, a collapse of sales in their key market of China, and the arrival of aggressive Chinese rivals on the continent.",
            "A further blow could be on the way from United States President Donald Trump, who is threatening tariffs that would upend the free-trade system underpinning Germany’s export-driven economic success.",
            "“The economy has been under a huge amount of pressure [that] was hidden by the fact that there was the pandemic and then the war,” said Nils Redeker, deputy director of the Jacques Delors Center think tank in Berlin. “It’s now coming to the forefront again and people are very, very concerned.”",
            "That’s having a knock-on effect on German politics.",
            "The troubles roiling Germany’s key sector are a major factor in Chancellor Olaf Scholz's likely ouster in the Feb. 23 election as voters sour on his economic agenda.",
            "With less than a week to go until the vote, Scholz’s opponent — the conservative alliance of Friedrich Merz — has 29 percent supportin polls, while his own Social Democratic Party (SPD) is third on 16 percent.",
            "But even a conservative win is unlikely to deliver a quick fix to the problems ailing Germany’s car industry.",
            "Layoffs across the sector, anemic economic growth, and the sense that Germany is no longer on the path of prosperity is deepening gloom in the country. That has aided the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, now second in the polls (21 percent), and has provided oxygen to the left-populist Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht (5 percent), known by its German acronym BSW.",
            "Although Germany is entering its third consecutive year of recession, the country’s economic woes can be traced back to 2019, when decarbonization efforts kicked off in earnest, threatening its traditional industrial prowess. Meanwhile, China, the country German industry once relied upon for massive profits, has become its biggest competitor.",
            "Germany’s auto giants got rich in China, entering the market decades ago when domestic car sales were just starting to creep up; their Asian success helped support higher wages at home.",
            "That trend reversed in 2018 when China’s market for new carscontractedfor the first time since the 1990s, falling 3 percent. It went down 8 percent more in 2019 before the pandemic ground global markets to a halt.",
            "These days, the market shares of the big three German automakers are shriveling as Chinese rivals introduce cheaper electric vehicles that often sport better technology.",
            "In 2024, BMW’s salesfell13 percent in China; Mercedes-Benzdropped7 percent; and Volkswagen — whichcounts Chinaas its largest market —declined10 percent.",
            "“It was so good in China for so long that the German carmakers, despite the troubles that they’re experiencing now, are trying to recreate the magic of past decades,” said Noah Barkin, a senior adviser with consultancy Rhodium Group.",
            "But Germany, and by extension Europe, has more on the line in China than just corporate profits.",
            "German automakers’ reliance on the Chinese market gives Beijing leverage over Berlin “because they can essentially weaponize these dependencies,” Barkin said.",
            "That, in turn, further endangers European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s China derisking strategy. The Commission last year slapped duties on made-in-China EVs even though Germanylobbiedagainst the measures, citing retaliation concerns.",
            "Merz vows to break that dependence on China — even if it costs carmakers. He has warned German companies against making bigger investments in China and has said not to comecrawlingback for a bailout should such wagers blow up.",
            "Adding to the troubles of carmakers are higherenergy costs, which soared in the aftermath of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, underscoring the risk inherent in Germany’s decision to make its economy dependent on cheap Russian gas.",
            "Pricey energy is also causing the costs of steel and aluminum — crucial inputs for the car industry — to gyrate. Worse still, Trump is targeting the two metals with his new tariffs.",
            "German carmakers are also saddled with the highest labor costs in the world — a legacy of powerful unions and decades of fat profits from China.",
            "Efforts to escape those costs are impacting the broader economy. From 2018 to 2023, as German automakers relocated to cheaper countries, production in Germany fell by 8 percent, according to a deindustrializationreportfrom the Commission.",
            "Squeezed by sagging sales and falling profits, the industry is scrambling to cope.",
            "Volkswagen last year stunned its unions by calling for a 10 percent pay cut and the closure of three car factories in Germany — the first time that’s happened in the company’s 87-year history. VW walked this back in the face of labor outrage and warning strikes, leaving the plants open — though workers did agree to pay and benefit cuts.",
            "German automakers have also bet big on the electrification of cars, investing billions in developing new models and retooling factories. But a decision in late 2023 by Scholz’s coalition to end generous EV subsidies kicked the legs out from under electric car sales in Germany.",
            "The shocks buffeting Germany’s largest industry and biggest employer are drawing in politicians.",
            "Together with other conservatives, Merz wants the European Union to scrap its planned phaseout of combustion engine cars by 2035. Both the AfD and the BSW are pushing for the same.",
            "That creates yet another potential post-election headache if Merz tries to build a grand coalition with the SPD or link up with the Greens, both of which back the 2035 measure.",
            "But carmakers aren’t all sold on the idea of messing with the EU targets, as that could throw their long-term investment plans geared toward going electric into disarray.",
            "Trump has thrown another curveball into that calculation by scrapping U.S. EV subsidies and demanding a “drill, baby, drill” return to oil and gas.",
            "Moreover, if he unleashes tariffs against Canada and Mexico, he could upenddecades of careful planningfor the North American market by German carmakers — adding to their bottom-line woes.",
            "Faced with the collapse of the model that made them — and Germany — rich, automakers face an existential challenge. Above all, they must figure out if Germany’s traditional engineering prowess is still capable of producing attractive EVs that defeat the Chinese competition and again make cars the driving force of the German economy.",
            "Merz would have to reform Germany’s sclerotic economy, notorious bureaucracy, high costs, and the ingrained risk aversion that is baked into policies ranging from dropping the debt brake preventing government borrowing to slashing cherished welfare benefits.",
            "That likely means closer cooperation with Brussels as the EU works to save the bloc’s industrial base from U.S. and Chinese competition, Redeker said.",
            "“The fact that Germany is part of the problem now maybe also makes it realize that Europe needs to be part of the solution,” he said.",
            "Merz has signaled a willingness to do just that, saying in aJanuary speechthat he will provide more robust leadership within Europe. The question is whether that’s enough to save Germany and its carmakers.",
            "“I would love to see Germany be a strong Germany in an even stronger Europe, but I have my doubts,” said Matthias Zink, president of auto supplier lobby CLEPA and CEO of car parts maker Schaeffler."

            "- hereinafter referred to as the “Contractor” -PreambleBMW and the Contractor have already worked for some years together, in\nparticular in the area of traffic telematics; the Contractor has rendered various services in this context as well as carried out the operation of telematics services for BMW.For the purpose of the facilitation of the further contractual co-operation, the future services, insofar as nothing is\nagreed to the contrary in individual cases, are to be rendered in principle in accordance with the following Framework Agreement by the Contractor for BMW. If the Contractor is instructed with the rendering of IT project services, usually industrial\nservices are to be rendered. Something different shall only apply if the Contractor exceptionally is not to bear any responsibility for the attaining of a particular result and the remuneration is to be made on a time and materials basis.1.Object of the Agreement1.1In the framework of this Agreement, the Contractor shall take over the construction of the works listed in the service description (pursuant to the respective individual contract).\nThis Agreement shall also apply to the ordering of services and the operation of telematics services.1.2The respective individual contract or services or industrial services shall contain, inter alia, a complete description of the scope of the services as well as a more detailed\ndescription of the test and acceptance criteria, the dates to be adhered to, the precinct description (Umfeldbeschreibung), the necessary documentation content and the collaborative service by BMW.1.3The individual contract or the operation of telematics services shall contain, inter alia, a description of the scope of the service, a Service Level Agreement, the collaborative\nobligations of BMW, the assumptions and boundaries regarding the operation of the services, the prices, conditions and issuing of invoices, the dates to be adhered to as well as the durations of the contract.1.4The entry into an individual contract shall take place in the form of a contractual document signed by both parties or through written confirmation of an order letter by the\nContractor. The Contractor shall confirm the order after receipt of the BMW order letter or inform it which changes are necessary for the entry into an individual contract.- 2 -1.5If reference is made in the individual contract to the service description, then this shall merely concern the technical part.1.6General terms and conditions of both contractual parties shall not apply; this shall be the case even if the general terms and conditions are not expressly objected to in the\nindividual case.This Framework Agreement shall\nnot give rise to any obligation to use services or to enter into individual contracts.1.7This Framework Agreement shall not apply in connection with the “Pre-Fit SIM” project.2.Execution of the Project in the Context of Services and/or Industrial Services2.1The project leader to be named by the Contractor shall plan, co-ordinate and monitor all of the interests and needs of the project. S/he shall be the responsible contact partner for\nthe BMW project leader.2.2The Contractor’s project leader shall inform the BMW project leader on a monthly basis about the status of the industrial service. S/he shall be obliged to also submit a\ncurrent project pursuit plan with commencement and completion dates, degree of completion and status of every main functionality.3.Changes and Additions to the Scope of the Service3.1All agreements (including Change Requests) which lead to changes of content or temporal changes shall require the written form and must be signed by both parties. In this regard,\nthe regulations of the Change Request Process agreed upon between BMW and the Contractor pursuant to Clause 3.2 hereof are to be complied with.3.2BMW shall be able to request changes (expansions/reductions) to the project regarding industrial services until acceptance, and regarding services as well as\nregarding the operation of telematics services during the term of the respective individual contract, insofar as this is reasonable for the Contractor - for example, with regard to its capacity. If substantial contractual stipulations (quality,\nprices, periods) will be influenced thereby, the Contractor is to inform BMW - insofar as nothing to the contrary has been agreed upon - within 9 working days in the form of an addendum offer or a detailed written statement, in the case of date- 3 -postponement, by a new time schedule. Otherwise it is to be assumed that the changes desired by BMW lie within the framework of the existing agreements.3.3To the extent that the agreements regarding industrial services exceed the agreed fixed price and the agreements regarding services as well as the operation of telematics services\nexceed the agreed price, the Contractor’s project leader shall give notification in accordance with Clause 3.2 above of the amount of the additional costs to be anticipated or estimated. The BMW project leader shall make a decision regarding\nthe execution according to that notification. In the case of execution, an addendum to the respective individual contract shall be drawn up.4.Collaborative ObligationsThe Contractor shall receive from BMW in a timely manner all of the documents, information, data and individual-contract-stipulated collaborative\nobligations of BMW necessary for the rendering of the service.5.Remuneration5.1The fixed price/price agreed upon in the respective individual contract shall apply.

            "The surge in energy prices, which started at the end of 2021, has severely impacted the euro area manufacturing sector, the output of which has declined below its pre-pandemic level in late 2024 (Figure 1). German industry was strongly affected (Bachmann et al. 2022) and experienced an even steeper contraction, reducing its output by approximately 10 percentage points. The weakness of the industrial sector in Germany is a reason for concern for the whole euro area: given the tight integration of manufacturing activity across euro area economies (Amador et al. 2015), developments in the German industry may generate significant externalities.",
            "Figure 1Manufacturing production indices (2019Q4=100)",
            "In a new paper (Flaccadoro 2024),1we shed light on three main factors that contributed to Germany’s relatively weaker performance in the past few years, and analyse the spillover effects to other euro area economies.",
            "First, the rise in energy costs in Europe affected manufacturers more severely in Germany than it did in other euro area countries.  Energy-intensive industries – i.e. those displaying a relatively high natural gas content in their production process2– account for a similar share of manufacturing in Germany and in the euro area overall. Likewise, there were no significant differences in gas prices between Germany and the euro area when looking at non-household heavy energy users over the past few years. Thus, it is plausibly the higher intensity of gas consumption in Germany’s gas-intensive industries that disrupted production there more than in other euro area countries, particularly in the chemical sector. Indeed, the chemical sector in Germany is more reliant on natural gas as an intermediate input than in other euro area countries because of its technological characteristics. Due to the chemical industry’s significant connections with other sectors, its weakness passed through to other energy-intensive industries, causing a more pronounced decline in production within German energy-intensive sectors compared to the euro area as a whole (Figure 2).",

            "Second, the slowdown in global demand for goods, rising trade fragmentation, and intensified competition from Chinese producers have impacted German manufacturing firms more than those in other major euro-area countries, due to Germany’s greater trade openness. In fact, in 2023 goods exports accounted for 34% of GDP in Germany, against 27% in Italy and 23% in France. Furthermore, Germany’s goods exports were more tilted towards China (6.1% of total goods exports, compared to 4.2% in France and 3.1% in Italy).3In addition, price competitiveness indicators computed by the Bank of Italy (Felettigh and Giordano 2018) show a deterioration for German manufacturers since mid-2022 with respect to other euro area countries, associated with the increase in energy costs and, later, the faster wage dynamics. This dynamic stood in contrast to the significant competitiveness gains achieved by German firms in the early 2000s following the Hartz labour market reforms (Fadinger et al. 2023).",
            "Consistently, German exports of goods have lost momentum: after increasing in the aftermath of the pandemic crisis, they declined below pre-pandemic values in the summer months of 2024 (Figure 3). In contrast, euro area exports increased by approximately 5% above their pre-crisis levels in the same period.",
            "Figure 3Exports of goods (2019Q4=100)",
            "The third factor is the downturn in the automotive industry, the weight of which is twice as relevant in Germany than in the euro area as a whole. This sector is affected by low demand and increasing competition from Chinese carmakers. Accordingly, quantitative demand-side indicators for the motor vehicle sector are consistent with lacklustre domestic demand for cars, as shown by the downward trend in car registrations in the euro area as a whole (Figure 4). Al-Haschimi et al. (2024) show that between 2019 and 2023, the euro area car industry faced adverse developments in its relative producer prices and a reduction in market shares with respect to Chinese manufacturers.4In particular, China is a fierce competitor for European car manufactures, as its low-cost electric vehicles (EVs) are exported to Europe in large numbers. Given that the EU represents the most important market for the exports of German EVs (85% of exports, almost $20 billion), China represents a critical source of competitions for German carmakers.",
            "Figure 4Car registrations (2019Q4 = 100)",
            "Finally, recent developments in the regulatory framework have sparked further uncertainty for car producers, both in Germany and in the EU. First, duties on the imports of electric vehicles from China, imposed by the European Commission in October 2024, could possibly induce some retaliation, dampening European car exports. Second, the potential re-opening of the 2035 zero emissions target for new cars and vans, which was adopted by the European Commission in March 2023 within the ‘Fit for 55’ deal, may induce EU households to postpone spending.",
            "We now present the results of a spillover analysis that allows us to quantify the interdependence of manufacturing activity across the main euro area economies. In particular, we follow the approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) and measure spillovers via the variance decomposition associated with a vector autoregressive (VAR) model. According to this approach, we estimate the spillovers from countryito countryjas the fraction of the forecast error variance decomposition at a six-month horizon in countryjdue to shocks originated in countryi. Our baseline estimates focus on the period January 2010 to December 2019, to avoid our results being affected by the global financial crisis and the pandemic-related disruption to economic activity, and use data referring to the manufacturing production index of nine economies (Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Finland, and Portugal). Our findings are robust to extending the period of analysis up to July 2024, or backward to January 2000, and to controlling for industrial developments in the US and China. The spillovers from the German industry to the manufacturing sector of other euro area economies are large. In fact, the shocks originated in the German industrial sector explain almost 31% of the forecast error variance of the Italian manufacturing activity six months later; while, shocks originated in the Italian manufacturing sector explain roughly 11% of the variability in German industrial activity. Spillover effects from Germany are also sizable for France and Spain; while the innovations originating in these two countries determine more attenuated spillovers in the German manufacturing sector.",
            "The challenges presented above are not likely to dissipate soon. First, EU gas prices are set to remain above pre-energy crisis levels in the years to come. Second, the outlook for demand remains subdued and geopolitical factors pose a downward risk for economic activity. Third, demand is particularly weak for firms in the automotive sector, whereby the competition from Chinese manufacturers is set to intensify in coming years, especially in the green energy technology segment.",
